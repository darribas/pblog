      <h1>photooftheday</h1>
<p class="subtitle">August 3, 2010</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm just wowed by <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/15131">this story</a> I've come across. It is something I've always wanted to do, to take a picture everyday and, after some time (say a month, a year, etc.) compile them. I think one can express so much about himself and so much can be told with little pieces of life over a sustained period of time. This guy <a href="http://photooftheday.hughcrawford.com/">did it</a> for 18 years until the day he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For some reason, I think it's in the social nature of human kind to feel attraction for other's lives, or maybe it's just me; anyhow, this kind of examples always touch me, especially when there is a tragic ending, as it is the case (that's another side of human nature I don't understand but it's there, the relevance tragedy gives to everything it touches...). I like thinking what I was doing during the story was happening and finding links between the story and myself, even though I don't know the person at all; in this case, I haven't been able to resist to check what he was doing <a href="http://photooftheday.hughcrawford.com/1984.htm#1984/1">the year I was born</a> and theÂ  vintage shots of New York City, a place I know and have been to, taken in a different time and from different perspective, feel just special.</p>
