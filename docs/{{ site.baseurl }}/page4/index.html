          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Last week, at the 53rd ERSA conference in Palermo, I had the pleasure to see Professor Masahisa Fujita deliver his keynote speech. In his last slide, he paid a tribute to German economist August Losch, one of the pioneers in introducing space into economic analysis and a person with a fascinating life. For my records, I'll copy here the first paragraph of the epilogue in his book "<a href="http://archive.org/details/economicsoflocat00ls"><em>Economics of Location</em></a>". Very powerfull stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If everything occurred at the same time there would be no development. If everything existed in the same place there could be no particularity. Only space makes possible the particular, which then unfolds in time. Only because we are not equally near to everything; only because everything does not rush in upon us at once; only because our world is restricted, for every individual, for his people, and for mankind as a whole, can we, in our finiteness, endure at all. The extent of this horizon differs, of course, from man to man. But in economic affairs, as in all other affairs, our ken is limited for acting intelligently and for finding our way through the complexities of life. And even within this little world, we are familiar with not more than its innermost circle. Depth must be bought with narrowness. Space creates and protects us in this limitation. Particularity is the price of our existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;">A. Losch, 1943</p>

      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/414782428">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      I've been using Python for quantitaive economics and geography for the last five years and I wish this book had been written back then. It is clear, easy to read, full of (cool) examples and incredibly useful, regardless of whether you read it from first to last page or have it around to check while hacking. If you are getting started on data crunching with Python, you should not miss it. If you are not new to the party, this will still be a good resource to get your head around a bit more advanced pandas, and the chapter on advanced Numpy is very informative too.</p>
<p>However, if you are over most of the learning curve, the book has a different feel. Although the title might suggest different, "Python for Data Analysis" is mostly "Pandas for Data Analysis". Fair enough, if you've written the library itself, it seems appropriate to focus on it, but I think it should be stressed from the beginning. Other crucial elements of the Python data stack (matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn...) are sometimes touched upon, but only briefly, and only to the extent you can relate them to pandas. I would have enjoyed it much more if those were covered a bit more in detail. Still, very good book.</p>

<p>      The book is a little slow and sleep-inducing if you're not "in the mood" for something like it. Expect less cartography and geography than philosophy and reflection. Although,  in its true meaning, not in the technical task of drawing boundaries, the job of a cartographer is much more about the latter than it is about the former. </p>
<p>I have particularly appreciated the discussion about subjectivity in the way we perceive and understand the world and the relevance of being open and ready to change one's view in some cases, throwing away or previous understanding and embracing someone else's if it looks more convincing. At least, making the effort to switch to "the other"'s position.  Ironic but powerful that a message to reject dogma in favor of reason comes from a Christian monk, but I guess that's what the Renaissance was about.</p>

      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/607075883">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      Exquisite short book that makes for a longer read because you want to hold on to it for as long as you can. In a series of short stories, Ehrlich narrates her experiences in Wyoming while working in a ranch. The book is beautifully written but, as a non-native english speaker, it does contain some passages/words a bit too hard.</p>
<p>I've always felt an inexplicable attraction for remote places, far landscapes and wild harsh nature, and this book encapsulates those three perfectly. Based on her own experiences, Ehrlich's reflects on ranchers, sheepherders, cowboys, native americans, and how they understand, repect and interact with their environment. Particularly inspiring are her views on human-animal and human-nature interactions, on which the usual either over-romantic or over-cruel view is absent. Her sober but powerful, first-person, account is probably the most appealing aspect of the book.</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Been reading a bit of Gretel Ehrlich lately. I spent last weekend back Home for a quick break from work and from feeling a foreigner. I sure had the former. I needed to reconnect, if only for a couple of days, with a part of my life I know is slipping away by the day. The crisis is turning the country where I grew up into a different place; my friends have left like me or moved on to something else; I, too, have changed. These days work takes up most of my time and brain power. I'm passionate about every bit, I see a greater end to it and, being very far away from my partner, putting more time now buys me more time to spend with her in the future. But it is also a trap. Unless you make a great effort, it is very easy to forget why you do it, what the real Ends are and, before you know, to find yourself into inertia and directionless moving. That's partially why I went Home. Because, even if "the past is a foreign country", every once in a while, it's good to be a tourist. And so I was. There is something inherently right to being with Friends and family, to being understood before you say anything. There are certain feelings that are off the list for me here in Amsterdam but that just show up as soon as I set feet Home, and I want them to be part of me. As my train was riding through Los Monegros, transporting me back to my present life, Ehrlich's words resonated at the back of my mind before I closed my eyes and fell asleep:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:justify;">"[…] We Americans are great on fillers, as if what we have, what we are, is not enough. We have a cultural tendency toward denial but, being affluent, we strangle ourselves with what we can buy. We have only to look at the houses we build to see how we build <em>against</em> space, the way we drink against pain and loneliness. We fill up space as if it were a pie shell, with things whose opacity further obstructs our ability to see what is already here."</p>
</blockquote>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/579111">In Europe: Travels Through the Twentieth Century</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/315969">Geert Mak</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/318599885">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The book is a travelogue of the year that Dutch Journalist Geert Mak took to travel throughout the continent as last century came to an end. The concept of journey is extended also over time in an account of the main events that filled the hundred years. Written very much In Mak's style, History is told as a collage of stories that cross, influence each other and follow their own path.</p>
<p>Be prepared to spend a long time with this book. Not because of all the pages it has, which are many, but because of the amount of events, persons and, above all, stories that will cross your eyes. Every chapter covers different episodes and, for me, it was hard to finish one and jump straight into the next one without allowing a few days to digest facts and feelings. If you're like me, who had put some events on the "do not touch" drawer since history classes in highschool, be prepared to meet the darkest face of Europe (and humans, by extension) over and over. The Wars, Hitler, the Wall, Ireland, Yugoslavia... the list is long. But also to realize the relevance of a European union, its origins and architects' dream; something particularly crucial in these days, when everything seems to be measured by the amount of euros that yields at the end of the year and the money seems to be in dismantling rather than in building Europe. Be prepared; after all, there's a lot that can happen in a century.</p>
