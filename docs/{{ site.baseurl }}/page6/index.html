      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/579111">In Europe: Travels Through the Twentieth Century</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/315969">Geert Mak</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/318599885">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The book is a travelogue of the year that Dutch Journalist Geert Mak took to travel throughout the continent as last century came to an end. The concept of journey is extended also over time in an account of the main events that filled the hundred years. Written very much In Mak's style, History is told as a collage of stories that cross, influence each other and follow their own path.</p>
<p>Be prepared to spend a long time with this book. Not because of all the pages it has, which are many, but because of the amount of events, persons and, above all, stories that will cross your eyes. Every chapter covers different episodes and, for me, it was hard to finish one and jump straight into the next one without allowing a few days to digest facts and feelings. If you're like me, who had put some events on the "do not touch" drawer since history classes in highschool, be prepared to meet the darkest face of Europe (and humans, by extension) over and over. The Wars, Hitler, the Wall, Ireland, Yugoslavia... the list is long. But also to realize the relevance of a European union, its origins and architects' dream; something particularly crucial in these days, when everything seems to be measured by the amount of euros that yields at the end of the year and the money seems to be in dismantling rather than in building Europe. Be prepared; after all, there's a lot that can happen in a century.</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Today I was in for some self-data hacking so I went to Facebook (Settings -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Download a copy of your Facebook data) and downloaded all the information they hold from me. I'll save you the boring stuff but I'll say it's not too difficult to grab all the time stamps from your wall. This means you can look at how activity (posts, replies, etc.) is distributed across time, and you can get pretty fancy because it's recorded down to seconds. However you don't have to get that detailed to get interesting things to pop up. Here is the volume of activity over last year, measured by week:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://dreamessenceonthemove.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/weeks1.png"><img id="i-579" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="/pblog/assets/2012/11/weeks1.png?w=580" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have interesting trends, maybe seasonal ups and downs, bla bla... But what is that peak towards the final weeks of the year that goes more than twice as high as the second busiest week? Let's zoom into that particular week to see if it helps:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://dreamessenceonthemove.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/week1.png"><img id="i-580" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="/pblog/assets/2012/11/week1.png?w=580" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mmm... the 7th. and 8th. of November look like the epicenter of this "burst of socialness" in my life. At that time, I was living 9 hours behind the good old Europe, so maybe one could argue actually those two are related and somehow part of those posts, likes, etc. on the 8th. are leftovers or people who "got late to the party". Anyway, what could it be? What would make my Facebook activity go bananas to that level? In applied Economics (as in most fields that deal with data), whenever you are stuck, rule number one is bring even more data to see if they show you what you are not seeing. So here is this additional "dataset" I came across:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://dreamessenceonthemove.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cumple1.png"><img id="i-581" class="size-full wp-image" alt="Image" src="/pblog/assets/2012/11/cumple1.png?w=580" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, for those academic geeks, that figure seems to me like the killer feature that gets the paper into the top notch journal of choice. For the rest of mortals reading this, I will just say <strong>thank you very much</strong> for being some part of my life and sticking to me over the years, even though "close" is probably not the best word to describe our physical locations. You are all somehow somewhere with me, though.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Instead of this, today I could have also replied every single of all those nice posts on my wall one by one. But if the pattern of last year shows up again (and I can tell it will, by midnight the count is on 65), who would want to spend hours writing back in boring Spanish and English when you can use that time to write in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29">Python</a>?</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12978407">The Long Run</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4805000">Mishka Shubaly</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/434474724">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      "The long run" is a short read. Not only because it's only about 60 digital pages but because once you start the first word, the next one comes natural all the way till the end of the story. Shubaly's account of his journey into alcoholic hell and back as an extreme runner is full of the traditional "sex, drugs and rock'n'roll", but also filled with humiliation, regret and honesty in telling how recovery has come to him.</p>
<p>I found out about the book thanks to his telling of "Shipwrecked" at The Moth podcast and that night started reading "The long run" right away. I put it down when I couldn't keep my eyes open any more, but first thing I did the morning after was finishing. And there's got to be something interesting enough to keep me away from breakfast.</p>
