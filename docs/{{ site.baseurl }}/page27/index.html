          <div><p align="justify">I wrote this text on my travel notebook during the flight back home from Seoul to Madrid and I translated it into english this morning on the bus to Zaragoza, my hometown. I didn´t make any correction before uploading it here, so they are just the raw words, exactly the same way they came from my pen. I hope you enjoy this at least as much as I did it while writing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><em><span>"It´s amazing how fast time runs when one is happy. I remember the day I landed in Korea as if it was yesterday: in my personal dictionary one couldn´t find any entry for the word “kimchi”; eating with chopsticks was nothing for me but a cultural experience, just like visiting a museum or looking at a picture; and hangul resembled my geometry lessons back in the days of school rather than a real written language. I had no clue at all about the place where I had just arrived. But I did have something that, flashing back now everything is over, turned out much more valuable: I had got time, time to discover and to learn. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Afterwards, I had the chance to get to know great people with whom, step by step and moment by moment, I filled a jigsaw which seemed irresolvable by the first day. Thus, all together we placed pieces made of mud, pottery and minced ice mixed with sparse fruit; pieces written in hangul characters, telling Korean contemporary history or decorated with Joseon Dynasty´s draws; of course, also Friday-night pieces which sounded like hip-hop and tasted like sohu and even some “made in China” ones seeped. We went to karaokes and sang luckily, alien to the fact that every song which finished took us closer and closer to the end of the party.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><em><span>This morning, I´ve left those survivors who have been able to scratch a few hours from their new life routines just to stay with me till very the end. I guess I never really knew how to say goodbye, and the word “thanks” is too short to fit all the feelings and smiles I wish I could put between the “t” and the “s”. I only find consolation by thinking if a guy decides not to sleep the night before class starts just to share it with me, it means that, at least a bit, he has had a good time close to me.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><em><span>The more I travel, the more I believe one finally leaves his hometown and becomes world citizen once he is able to be happy in any remote place and with people from every corner of this planet. I speak for me, but I think there´s a bit of everyone in it if I say that this now-ending month has made us slightly more habitants of this global hamlet we´ve been bound to live in than before.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" class="MsoNormal"><em><span>In Spain, we usually say that experience is a comb life gives you once you´ve already become bald. Today, kimchi accounts for several lines in my own life dictionary; chopsticks are nothing but an extension of my hands when it´s time to eat; and hangul is something at least I can read if I see it written. But I don´t have time any more and in my jigsaw there´s only one empty space which is reserved for the tears these lines have taken me. Yet I´m glad because I know that once I hang it in my room of the memories I´ll be able to glance at it and think: yes, I did go there and I was happy."</span> </em></p>

Definitely, it's not the best way to welcome a 12-hours flight to take me back home.</p>
<p align="justify">And, with no doubt at all, I couldn't have imagined myself a better last night in Korea. Sweet because it happened, bitter because it's over. And I cannot help remembering once again that sentence of the song:</p>
<p align="center"><em>...I mean I love to travel, </em><em>I hate to fly</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>I want to go, but hate goodbyes...</em></p>

          <div><p align="justify">It's already been almost one week in the island and time keeps on running like hell. On sunday, we left Taipei and went down to Taijung, my friends's hometown. All along these days, I've visited many temples (taoist most of them, thought I've also seen confucianist and Buddhist), eaten like I never expected and taken some glimpses of taiwanese nature. It seems I'm sort of lucky because as soon as I left Taipei, it started raining up there and now they are flooding (hope there's no problem with my flight on sunday), and here there's no trace of the typhoon.</p>
<p align="justify">I'd write many things about Taiwan and its people, but I prefer taking it easy, writing them down on my notebook (i'm already doing so) and once I get back home, uploading them here with a bit more of "style". By now, I'll just say it's really worth coming to the island.</p>
<p align="justify">I still have two days left here and on sunday i'll catch a plane to Seoul, where i'll be for a night and I hope i'll meet all my Korean friends for the last time in a while. On monday after-noon, i'll cath the plane back home and i'll land in Madrid at 21:30 local time. I don't know whether i'll go back home directly or i'll spend one night in Madrid and take the bus to Zaragoza next morning yet. The adventure is coming to end...</p>

          <div><p align="justify">Yesterday, we couldn't do that much because of the typhoon: authorities had allowed people not to go working so most of the stores were closed, and most of people stayed at home too (even though it wasn't as hard as one could expect when hearing the word "typhoon"). The only thing we could do then was eating, eating and, when there was nothing left to do, we ate a bit more. Katie is totally introducing me into taiwanese cuisine and even into chinese language (you should have heard me asking for Chua Bin...).</p>
<p align="justify">Today we are leaving Taipei on the way to Taijung, Katie's hometown. We don't know yet where we'll be able to go because, since though the typhoon is gone, it might have left behind some traces. I don't know whether i'll have internet access in the next days either, so don't be afraid if you don't see any update here. Mom, Dad, I'll be safe :)</p>

          <div><p align="justify">Yesterday I was walkking around the old centre of Taipei almost all the day long. I the night, I met my friend from Sweden and some friends of her for a drink, trying to get deeper into taiwanese culture, hehe. Today I've just waken up and had breakfast and now waiting for my friend coming from Taijung this morning. We'll stay in Taipei at least one more day and, if the weather allows us, we'll go travelling the island around on sunday or monday.</p>
<p>The only con is this:</p>

<p>Typhoon SEPAT</p>
<p align="justify">A large &amp; very powerful storm. Strongest winds are at the center of the storm, upwards of 155mph/250kph making it a Category 4 hurricane in the west. Will begin Influencing the island Friday morning 8/17. Landfall forecast for Hualien Taidong on Saturday morning 8/18 around 5am. On Saturday 8/18 strongest winds will be in Hualien/Taidong, while heaviest rains are forecast for North &amp; NE Taiwan. The storm should be past the Island by Sunday 8/19.</p>

<p align="justify">Yet, locals are not that worried, neither am I. It looks like it'll last for 2 or 3 days and the precaution we are required to take is staying away from he mountains and the beach and shuting down AC and windows. I guess I can handle it. Mom, Dad, I'll be safe ;)</p>

          <div><p align="justify">I've already left Korea after a very active night (I stayed up late and woke up at 7:00am), so I guess I haven't been able to feel anything but extremely tired and sleepy. I did feel a lot of things, but I still have to take them out of me and put them down on a paper before you can read them. My korean buddy (super-kind, as usual) has taken me to the airport and dropped me in front of the passport checkpoint. Around 3 hours of flight and here I am in the island. Extra-tired, but extra happy. No typhoons, no bad karma; just a lot of lights and high buildings.</p>
<p align="justify">When talking about Taiwan, they say it's one of the kindest populations in the world. I don't know whether that's true or not, but I've been in the island only for a few hours and there's already been a guy who has found me looking for my hostel in the middle of the street and, without asking him anything, has taken me to the entrance of the hostel, which is located in the 13th. floor of a big building right in front of the main station. I think I love Taiwan.</p>
