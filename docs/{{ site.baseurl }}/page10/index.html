          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">If there is something of interest for the greater public in the dissertation I defended last monday, that is the acknowledgements section. I wrote that last june when I finished the draft and will not add much now, other than explicitly mentioning they are completely honest, they reflect only real feelings (with the exception of the funding institution). I will paste them without any further editting, just as they appear in the manuscript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This document comprises most of the work I have carried out as a PhD. student during the last four years. It has been a period of my life in which I have had the opportunity to meet, work and learn surrounded by a group of people I feel priviledged for being able tocall friends. Some of them were known; some others appeared down the road that has taken me through different situations, continents and institutions; all of them have collaborated, one way or another, to make this dissertation exist today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, it deserves special mention my supervisor, Fernando Sanz-Gracia. Over this time, both personally and through a computer following me all around, his dedication and conﬁdence in every moment, his complete willingness to, far from imposing, leave me make my own decissions and the certainty that, whatever the outcome, he would always be on my side, have made me succeed, and have turned the tutor-student relation into one of<br />
true friendship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This work would have not happened either without the love and inconditional support of my father Antonio, my mother Natividad and my brother Miguel, my grandparents Antonio, Mauricia, Maximiliano and Antonia, as well as the rest of my family, who have been able to understand my need to travel and constantly leave home, and have been a crucial pillar in the toughest times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides my supervisor, Universidad de Zaragoza has given me the chance to get to know other people who, one way or another, have inﬂuenced me. I would like to thank: Marcos Sanso Navarro and Domingo Pérez Ximenez-de-Embún for showing me in the best possible way how a lot of things about the University no book can teach actually work; Marcos Sanso Frago and the rest of the ADETRE research group with whom I have interacted for their valuable comments and contributions; and the group of students who have passed by the Graduate Students Room 1 of the Faculty of Economics, with whom I have shared the experience to get ready a PhD. dissertation, for cheering up and making long days of work more bearable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These four years have also seen me spend some time in other institutions abroad in which I have been lucky to meet people who have strongly inﬂuenced both my work and my person. I would like to thank: Luc Anselin and Sergio J. Rey for giving me the opportunity to spend 12 months at the GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation, in Tempe (USA), and for being a constant source of inspiration and guidance; Julia Koschinsky for the support given in both contexts academic and personal, as well as for understanding and sharing a common vision of the world, which has created a close friendship; and David Folch, Charles Schmidt, Nancy Lozano-Gracia and the rest of the center staff for kindly welcoming me and sharing so much knowledge with me. Within the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam (Netherlands), I would like to thank: Peter Nijkamp and Henk Scholten for inconditionally opening me the Department of Spatial Economics and<br />
SpinLab; Eric Koomen, Chris Jacobs, Chequita R. Bhikhi, Eva Gutiérrez-i-Puigarnau and Michiel Gerritse, as well as the rest of people I got to know during the months I spent in Amsterdam and who, one way or another, made my visit more productive and pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to express my gratitude to the Ministry of Science and Innovation at the Spanish Government (SEJ2006-04893, AP20063563, ECO2009-09332 and FEDER funding) for the ﬁnnancial support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I want to acknowledge the work and effort put, as well as to thank the free/libre and open source software international community, for showing me a new way to understand cooperative work and providing me with a set of tools without which this document would have not been possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would also like to thank: my closest friends, the RK crew and all the people around the world who love me, for always reminding me who I am and accepting me as such; rap music and urban poetry for showing me the most human side of cities, my subject of study.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, I want to dedicate this work to someone who will never read it: my grandfather, Maximiliano Arribas, who passed away on March 19th. 2010 while I was thousands of  kilometers away from home.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Mañana, como he hecho en cada examen desde que el salió el album (2001), escucharé esta canción justo antes de "entrar en escena". Es importante tener alguna superstición, nos hace más humanos.</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">On this morning bike ride (mostly on non-wehicule trail), I listened to PRI's "The Changing World" podcast, a series of documentaries about global issues, very interesting topics usually. <a href="http://www.podcastdirectory.com/podshows/8540726">Today's show </a>was on <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, Burmese freedom activist and Nobel Peace Price laureate, who's been under one way or another of arrest for the last 20 years (currently under house arrest by the militar goverment of the country). It's about half an hour of very powerful and strong stuff. I'll post here the quote that made me drop a couple of tears of joy (I'll claim it was the cold that made it for the public record...) while pedalling, the rest is left for you to dig it up.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I am happy because I am free, free from fear..."</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">It's pretty amazing how music shapes moments and, at the same time, how the way we get to know albums and songs influences our taste for them. Today at the end of the work day I came across <a href="http://http//thequietus.com/articles/05329-deftones-chino-interview-favourite-records">this post</a> in which Chino Moreno, Deftones' band leader and one of my teenage icons, lists 13 of his most influencial/favourite musical works. I had to run so I've only digged until the <a href="http://http://thequietus.com/articles/05329-deftones-chino-interview-favourite-records?page=3">third album</a> he mentions, <em>Sunset Mission</em> by "Bohren Und Der Club Of Gore". As a big influence, I've always taken Chino's view (interviews, musical taste reflected on his career, etc.) pretty seriously, so I've rushed to google the album and get a copy, which has gone straight into my iPhone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Mission"><img class="aligncenter" title="Sunset Mission" src="/pblog/assets/2010/11/bohren%2B%26%2Bder%2Bclub%2Bof%2Bgore%2B-%2Bsunset%2Bmission.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="314" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm now back to the appartment they've put me in Amsterdam for this week (a beautiful old building by the Amstel) after a beer with a friend in one of those low-light cozy bars in the Pijp, for which Amsterdam is pretty good at. Of course, on the walk back I've had <em>Sunset Mission</em> on my ears; and it couldn't have been a better fit. In the post, Chino talks about how he loves movie soundtracks, and you can taste that flavour in here: the atmosphere created by the blend of jazz and suspense makes whatever you're doing while listening the scene of a story, a movie in which you're the main character instead of the spectator. All of a sudden,  closed vintage shops, rooms seen from the street through windows and the city lights reflected on the river have created a page on a graphic novel or a shot from a Twin Peaks moved a few thousands kilometres away. Pretty amazing. I particularly like how he labels the album as 'metal' when in fact it's pure jazz and ambient. Parental advisory: only for night animals.</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">In this days where emails longer than 2 sentences for something non-work-related are almost romantic, I've got one ending by "...I'm really glad you're in this world, Dani..."; in which an iPhone has more computing power than the most powerful computer from last decade, "somebody" gave me yesterday a <a href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~wolff/calculators/Olivetti/Underwood200-927-IMG_2987-5.jpg">calculator</a> that has no single electronic component; and last, the most subversive one, in an era where hate is becoming common currency, signs of love have come from all over the planet, from the desert in Phoenix to the jungle in Thailand or the lovely Amsterdam and Seoul.

          <div><p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1015276/movieR.zip">[Download]</a> <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1015276/movieR%20.txt">[Source]</a> <a href="http://darribas.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=82&amp;lang=en">[Documentation]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is pretty certain by now we live in a data world: institutions, companies, cell-phones... we are all constantly creating and storing data, even if we don't know it. Things as they are, this' come to a point where the problem is usually not to obtain the right data but to discard the wrong ones. Besides, apparently "<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/01/steve-jobs-peop/">people don't read anymore</a>", less to talk about reading data... So the other day, I had another of this horrible moments where you think something <em>kind of cool</em> is going to take 5 minutes to accomplish. The idea seemed pretty simple, so I gave it try. Today, 5 minutes (and 3 more nights) afterwards I've finished movieR.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>idea</strong> is simple: you have a bunch of data that represent some phenomenon (say, income per capita), for some individuals (say a few countries) and for a few years; and you want to see whether the distribution of the variable has changed over time and, if so, how.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">MovieR is a small set of functions written in R that draws a bunch of density kernels (for each period and to smooth the transition) and pastes them into a movie using the free/libre software package <a href="http://dvd-slideshow.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page">dvd-slideshow</a>. It takes a csv looking like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="text"]<br />
&quot;y2000&quot;,&quot;y2001&quot;,&quot;y2002&quot;,&quot;y2003&quot;,&quot;y2004&quot;,&quot;y2005&quot;<br />
&quot;29392.85&quot;,&quot;30125.1&quot;,&quot;31396.76&quot;,&quot;32353.47&quot;,&quot;33898.93&quot;,&quot;34460.48&quot;<br />
&quot;30451.79&quot;,&quot;31075.53&quot;,&quot;32344.51&quot;,&quot;33678.8&quot;,&quot;35310.66&quot;,&quot;36520.62&quot;<br />
...<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And gives out something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vimeo 16203102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This allows you to get a good sense of the behaviour of the dataset and some of its main properties in a quick glance. For example, in the video above, which uses <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/OECDStat_Metadata/ShowMetadata.ashx?Dataset=METRO&amp;Lang=en&amp;">OECD data</a>, the distribution of per capita income across a set of 59 cities all over the world from 2000 to 2007 is displayed; one can easily see the distribution has moved rightwards over the years, implying a move towards higher income per capita for more people over the years, as well as a flattening of the curve, that is an equalizing effect across the cities. And, to  please Mr. Jobs, all that without reading a single bit :-)</p>
