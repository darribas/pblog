      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99886">Brazil: Five Centuries of Change</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/462">Thomas E. Skidmore</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/359011155">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      I picked up this book one week before visiting the country to get a bit of background on a then completely unknown part of the World. The book does a decent job at that. Starting with the Portuguese gives a long term perspective that I certainly enjoyed and gives the author the chance to dig into the the deep reasons of some of the main characteristics of today's Brazil. The main drawback I found is that, although the book's not very dry, it has been written by a hardcore historian, not a journalist or traveler. Expect to get all the dates, names and events, but maybe not a good human reconstruction of what it was like to live in the Brazil of the past.</p>

          <div><p>All of a sudden, I was leaving customs at Sao Paulo's international airport. My friend Ana was waiting at the other side and the smoothness that had accompanied me over the 12h flight and the airport controls just continued. She drove me to the hostel (yes I'm going backpacker this time until I enter work mode) and after check in we went for dinner. We ate Moroccan and you'd be mistaken to think it's something you shouldn't do here. "The most typical food Sao Paulo is known for is its international cuisine", I was told. And food it's only a good metaphor of the bigger picture. I used to think globalization was an invention of the West. Cathedrals of this religion were New York, London and even Tokyo. World hubs that act as collectors of different realities, cultures and personal stories that cross, usually with the hope of improving life conditions. In this naive picture, the "periphery" had the only role of supplier. Boy how mistaken was I. Sao paulo's 17 million people make it not only the largest metropolis of Latin America but one of the most diverse places I've been to. Start with the already hard to define Brazilian character (an amazing mix of indians, Europeans and Africans). Add the Japanese largest community outside Japan, and so many other layers of identities that have been added and mixed over its relatively short history. And the West here is not even a supplier any more.</p>
<p>Today we've been walking most of the day, eating and talking about the city, the country and what involves to be a Brazilian today. It is an exciting time to visit this country because I'm sure if I come in a few years I'll be seeing such a different place. The picture I'm drawing reminds a lot to the Spain of the sixties and seventies I learnt at school and through my grandparents. Ana's generation, like my parent's, is the first one to have access in (relative) mass to many things we take for granted (although maybe not for too longer) in the Welfare Europe, and the sense of out of control most of the development in the city has is clear sign of the speed at which things are changing here. The feeling is similar in that regard to what it was to visit Mumbai or Bangkok: monsters that grow as a collective effort of millions of people but where no one really nows exactly what the effects of his actions will be. And sure enough, not everything is Perfectland: inequality is soaring and all you have to do to get a sense of the extent of pollution is to look at the color of "white" buildings downtown, to give a couple of examples. One thing is sure: this is not a stopping point but a snapshot in the middle of continuous change. And I'm happy I was lucky enough to be able to "have my camera at hand" to shoot it.</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607">The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5790">Niall Ferguson</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/331517532">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The book is an overview of the history of finance and banking, from its rudimentary origins in Mesopotamia and Europe to the current financial engineering from Wall St. I think it stands as a very accessible entry gate to this particular world ("Planet Finance" as he calls it) and does a good job at presenting the topic in both an attractive and easy to understand for a non-familiarized audience. </p>
<p>On the minus side, I would highlight the fact that the author is clearly biased and very partial in several passages of the book. His conservative views, "understanding" of the right-wing rich world and uneasiness with more liberal characters such as P. Krugman or G. Soros make the more left-wing reader feel like he is only being shown one part of the story. In effect, there are very few instances where the author alludes to the social consecuences of some of the financial decisions made by the brilliant and successful people he presents and seems to adore. The good news is that it is so obvious when he is being partial that it makes it easier to catch and allows to better cast a shadow of doubt and criticism, something absent in the manuscript.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it is a book that does a decent job at educating a broad audicence and that, although (or rather because) it takes a long-term perspective, today more than ever is a recommened read.</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13347339">Facts are Sacred</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/576848">Simon Rogers</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/258953597">2 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The book is a short compilation of experiences encountered by The Guardian journalists in dealing with what is come to be known as "data journalism". Throughout eight chapters, several loosely related topics are exposed, from what they consider "data journalism" is to how crowdsourcing can help it.</p>
<p>It really is a short read, but I think it should have actually been shorter. Some of the chapters feel too forced to be in the book, almost just to fill pages. As an example, the last one is a simple compilation of facts based on different statistics that are presented to the reader with not context or framework whatsoever. I think that chapter in particular does a poor job at helping illustrate how data can create, reinforce and make stories more appealing and insighful in journalism.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I greatly enjoyed the first three chapters, where the concept is presented from first hand (The Guardian is indeed at the forefront of data journalism) and some experiences are shared in relation to the work they've done, for example trying to make sense out of UK government data  and bringing WikiLeaks data to the main public.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is a short book worth reading and with some interesting views on how journalism is to change in the next decades, but it would probably have to be shorter.</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13482301">Machine Learning for Hackers</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5271568">Drew Conway</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/282625894">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The book is a hands-on review of the main topics of machine learning (ML). All along the chapters, the authors gently walk the reader through examples with real world data, paying particular attention to the more practical aspects of the implementation of the analysis and showing a lot of R code, which becomes a de-facto replacement for the equations one would expect to see in a purely stats book.</p>
<p>This approach has several nice advantages, of which I'll highlight three: first, the use of real world data and stories shows the readily applicability of ML and introduces a way of understanding the world we live in through numbers; second, the non-technical but rather practical approach makes the book much more readable than a purely math-type textbook; and third, you get to learn some cool R tricks and libraries, which is never to be underestimated. </p>
<p>If any, the only downside I would point out is that it falls a bit short in introducing the statistical methods and background behind the algorithms. As a quantitative social scientist, I am used to more depth in explaining the "science" behind practice, and the book tends to skip those explanations as soon as they get a little heavy. I guesss for that there are other references and, as I said, it makes the book much more readable from cover to cover. At any rate, great entry port to the field if you like code more than equations.</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11809246">Bird on Fire: Lessons from the World's Least Sustainable City</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/48874">Andrew Ross</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/238831656">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The book is an attempt to critically evaluate the concept of sustainability in the metropolitan area of Phoenix, keeping always an eye on the lessons and aspects that may apply beyond the region.  Throughout eight chapters, the author exposes his view backed up by an extensive literature review as well as numerous interviews to activists, academics, politicians and citizens engaged in the struggles and key issues of the future of the city. Recognizing its usual low priority in the the policy agenda, Andrew Ross pays particular attention to the idea of environmental justice and the social aspect of sustainability, arguing that the sustainable future will be socially inclusive and just or it will not be.</p>
<p>As a foreigner temporary living in Phoenix, the book has been an invaluable source of information to get both the background and history of the city as well as the state of opinion (some of the facts reach past 2011) regarding several key topics. Often times during the months I've been reading the book, I've found myself coming back to some of the facts and background offered in the book and relating many places, names and events to one or another chapter. Definitely a useful read for the newcomer to the region. One last tip (and a mental note to myself): if you are unsure about committing to read the the more than 300 pages, get a taste of the main issues brought to debate as well as the author's position in all of them in the slightly more than 10 pages of the last chapter.</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">El lunes, mi abuelo Antonio se vistió "de domingo" y se preparó para ir a dar un paseo en el día de la ciudad en la que pasó buena parte de su vida. Al levantarse de la silla después del desayuno, notó un poco de mareo y decidió tumbarse a ver si se le pasaba. Nunca más se levantaría. Mientras tanto, yo dormía a diez mil kilómetros de casa y sólo me enteraría ocho horas después cuando, al despertarme, encontré en mi bandeja de entrada un correo de mi madre con el título "Últimas noticias desde Zaragoza". El mensaje no tenía más de seis líneas y, aún así, me costó leerlo en torno a una hora. Sesenta minutos para intentar asimilar esas palabras que flotaban en la pantalla de cristal líquido de mi ordenador, cuyo significado entendía pero que, desde la otra punta del mundo, parecían todavía más irreales.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufrir la pérdida de un ser querido desde la distancia es un poco como las letras de la pantalla. No puedes tocarlo pero sabes que tiene significado real. Tu corazón entra en lucha constante con el resto del mundo para no olvidar que, a pesar de que todo tu entorno es completamente ajeno a ello, en tu Casa alguien falta. Y luego está ese inevitable sentimiento de culpa por no poder estar físicamente allí cuando realmente piensas que es el único lugar en la tierra en el que, en ese preciso momento, tiene sentido estar pues todas tus obligaciones, alegrías y problemas se han vuelto tan pequeñas que apenas si existen. Te sientes Lejos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dicen que las personas morimos dos veces, una cuando nos vamos de este mundo y otra cuando todo aquello que nos recuerda desaparece finalmente. Cómo otros nos mantienen en su mente nos da una segunda vida en tanto en cuanto seguimos siendo parte de ellos. En mi memoria, mi abuelo Antonio estará siempre contento de vivir. Está subiendo a casa a comer un sábado después tomar una tapa con sus amigos, o preparándome tostadas de salmón ahumado que sabe que me encantan. Estará dando un paseo con mi abuela por el Torresol y la ciudad universitaria, al lado de su casa, o eligiendo durante horas el mejor melón de la tienda, el más dulce y sabroso de todos. Seguro que habrá visto el Arguiñano y habrá cogido un par de ideas para la cocina y reposará en el sillón después de comer viendo el tenis. De una forma u otra, estará siempre disfrutando de las pequeñas cosas que hacen la vida grande y asegurándose que aquellos a los que quiere las disfrutan también.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desde luego nada lo devolverá a este mundo, pero al menos en esta segunda vida no hay ninguna distancia que se interponga, pues viene conmigo muy cerca de mí en cada viaje que hago y se parece mucho más a las fotografías que artesanalmente reveló (dibujó) en papel de verdad durante buena parte de su vida que a las letras de cristal líquido que me contaron que ya no está.</p>
