          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Dear Spatial Analysis community:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a by-product of last summer's <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/node/661" target="_blank">Workshop in India</a>, the GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation has started a new<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spatial_analysis_software" target="_blank"> WikiPedia page to list Spatial Analysis Software</a>. As it is now, it is just a beginning with a small subset of it, but the goal is to end up with a <strong>comprehensive list of packages written to enable spatial analysis</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is structured as a sortable table with the following columns: 'Package' (name), 'Free of charge' (yes/no), 'Operating Systems' (platform), 'Developer Institution/person', 'Website' (link to the projects page), 'Field of interest (if any specific)', 'Main Features', 'Language' (programming language use), 'License' (in order to know degree of freedom in the code).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To edit, just click on the tab 'edit this page' on the top of the page and edit. All the changes go live, so make sure you want to do that change before clicking on "Save changes". If you want to add a new package (row in the table), it is recommended to copy and paste the block of an existing one and edit the new one there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We would like to invite you all to take a look at it and help improve it. The beginning of the page is like pushing a snowball from the top of the hill, what it is to come will be up to the community!</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">A series of events in the last days have got me round here back again. I remember last summer having a conversation around a beer in Yosemite, a friend of mine used the word 'aseptic' to describe my year in the US. The context was different then, but at that time I found the word to fit the experience pretty well.<br />
With a little bit more of reflection, now I think it was not. I lived a lot, in a way I hadn't before; I met brilliant and inspiring people and realized I truly like what I do for a living, put aside the ton of stuff I learnt, academic-wise. But probably the most important thing I left the US with was the convincement that "I can". It sounds halfway between corny and very american, in the european despective way, but only if you haven't ever felt it. The most relevant change in me after the US year was to wake up to the fact that it is possible to live your own way, to create and follow your own path; and even more important, this whole thing probably only makes sense if you do so. You don't have to give up on what you believe because they say it's the 'only' way; you can write your story, and you'd better do, because if you miss the True Meaning, that 'something' that makes all the rest small and wakes you up in the morning, you're going nowhere, whatever others tell you. Taking that to reality and making it happen is probably a different animal, but even if the road to get there is tough, it's better to know what the destination is. Last summer, I was also fortunate to be involved in one of the most meaningful projects I've ever collaborated with that took me to India. When we were packing, Julia concluded that maps and guides are part of the tourist toolkit and, as such, we should avoid them. Instead, she bought two compasses for us to navigate around Mumbai and gave one to me. For the joy of our relatives and beloved ones, we never got to use them, but I did keep mine and, today, while I was looking for something else in my bag, I stumbled across it. I can't think of a better gift to represent what I mean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As good as it was, however, the American year did not come for free. For the first time in my life, I understood the meaning of 'far', sadly realized one can't be in two places at the same time, and I learned that the hard way. Furthermore, for ten months I put aside many feelings, (unconciously) stopped taking pictures and writing and almost got convinced the best way you can use your time, always, is working. When I came back to Spain for Christmas and could zoom out a little bit from the day-to-day life, I realized that was not totally right and maybe a little time in Europe would do me some good. And here is where Amsterdam comes in. It's now been roughly a month and a half, but it feels way longer; definitely life's not to be measured in seconds but in moments. Events have compressed incredibly and the 8-hours sleep and quiet life I used to have has just vanished and been replaced by a rollercoaster of feelings and emotions, ups and downs in which happiness mixes sometimes with frustation, uncertainty and fatigue with the only constant of never being mild. It is still too early but, if there is a lesson I can take from all this stream, it's that living and experiencing is always worthwhile, that the only true regret comes from what we do NOT do and that good and bad, sweet and bitter, need each other to define themselves. I also think I am starting to understand that quote from the movie 'Monsieur Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran' about the Arab view of love, giving and feelings ("<em>your love is yours, it belongs to you. (...) Whatever you give is yours forever. Whatever you keep gets eternally lost</em>") which never really made sense before. Only six weeks, but it's been time enough to get back on my shots (ok, until my camera broke), on my urban walks and on my lyrical side. And certainly, it's been time enough to get me writing again.</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So this morning got on a plane again. Pretty early, as usual, and pretty tired, as usual too, again <em>hitting the road</em>. I've found (again) an excuse good enough to spend some (more) time away from my beloved ones; this time I will spend four months at the Department of Spatial Economics of the Free University of Amsterdam (Netherlands) pushing forward my dissertation and whatever else tomorrow brings up. I'm totally braindead right now, after fliying, carrying my three bags around all day and fixing a little bit my new home, but somehow <a href="http://www.looptrooprockers.com/video-promoe-mammas-gata-feat-timbuktu-supreme-andreas-grega/">this</a> song has got me writing...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sort of feel like travelling again. A month ago, when I got back from India all I wanted was to find a little peace of mind and rest of planes, airports, continents, time lags and new things; just some time in an evironment I knew very well with people to whom I didn't have to explain anything because they knew it before I'd open my mouth. That's been pretty much my August: (almost) no planes, family, friends and my hometown. But this is a luxury I think I can't afford right now. I feel like <em>I have to go</em> out there again, discover and live more because tomorrow might be too late or might just not be. So here I am, while all my friends are clebrating one of them's birthday, I'm in front of a window where the white apple of my laptop reflects and beyond which there's a whole great city waiting with more adventures to come. But that starts tomorrow, now I'm off, bed calls...</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So, after a couple of really hectic days learning why India is becoming one of the main countries in the world (and also teaching a workshop to realize it...), we've taken off Bangalore this after-noon and landed in Mumbai at 5 pm. After 2 hours in a cab to make the less than 10 Km to the hotel we've found out the place we had booked turns out to be a little bit different from what we expected (it's actually a pretty western place with most of what I don't like of it but anyway...). Tomorrow we'll try to see a bit of this huge monster called Mumbai and at the end of the day, we'll head to the airport to take the flight back to Europe. Then connection to Madrid, bus and finally home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So many amazing stuff that's changed many views and strength some others, but getting into the details is something for later on when I'm back, I make some sense out of this whole thing and  I can meet you for a coffee or a beer and tell you. By now, it's time to try to find a local place to have a bite of real India...</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">After three days in the middle of a 1100m. high tea plantation trying to understand why elephants hit human settlements from time to time, to set up a woorkshop pretty much from scratch and to ignore the fact that it seems someone up there forgot to close the tap and it's pouring down like crazy (some call it monsoon), tomorrow we are heading to Bangalore to teach the actual workshop on wednesday and thursday (tuesday is all for prep).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These have been a mix of the almost stressing peace you find here, the actual stress of seeing the workshop coming and not having it ready and the joy and greatness of all the learning we are doing and the people we are meeting. Pix and more to come but by now I just wanted the world know I'm still alive and safe at the end of it. The next days will be pretty hectic with all the preparation and workshop, but being here, surrounded by all the wildlife sounds once darkness has taken over, it feels hard to get into that mood of action and  movement...</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Last sunday, after a very hectic week in Barcelona at the SEA meeting and then in the Pyrenees, I got on a bus to Madrid Barajas at 3am; 4  hours later I was taking off to Munich where I had a great day visiting the main spots of the city. A day after we took a connection flight to Frankfurt and then took off to Mumbai. Seven hours later we tried to get to the hotel (1.5 Km away from the airport) and it took us good 20 minutes due to the moonson rain that was pouring. It's 3am on a monday and all I can think of is getting some sleep because we are at the destination yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8am of wednesday, the wake-up call from reception sounds and gotta get on move again. Back to the airport (now in the domestic flights terminal), a few security controls, normal wait and we're on the air again on our way to Coimbatore, where the airport is not more than a small building where you get your luggages out of the cart that brings them from the plane. There we meet Shankar, our host, who takes us for a great meal and then to the Valparai plateau, where we'll spend the next four days. The drive goes through many small villages crowed with people, animals, small houses that seem about to crumble and big Vodafone signs. The landscape is amazing and I just feel like if the car window was a TV showing a wildlife documentarry. After a couple of hours of that, we start going uphill and nature gets wilder: the plain gets substituted by the jungle where only the road gives a little of open space. At the top, the tea plantation domains but I'm so tired I can just see the guest house where they are hosting us and the bed inside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ten minutes of drive from there is Valparai and the field station of the team we work with. From there you can see the tea plantation and the curtain of rain that seems to be part of this landscape as much as the trees or the tea leaves. There is where I write this piece of information from and, afer 10 hours of sleep, this starts looking much better...</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">For whatever reason, I hadn't open this pad in too long; it was even about to get lost in the last moving out. For any cause, I was about to buy into the idea that writing myself out was something for "whenever you have some spare time". But I just hung my old Vans on a power wire, and I can't think of anything more poetic other than giving "Confieso que he vivido" by P. Neruda to someone who leaves to find on the road. Tomorrow I'll shave and then catch the plane, and I'm pretty sure, from that moment on, work and everything else waiting for me at home will weight enough so as not to keep on top these pieces of lived poetry I'm trying to put in words.</p>
<p>We live in such a digital world, where distances are often but anecdotes and where the possibilities of exchange are such that not giving it a try sounds like really stupid. Yet I hope means don't keep me away from the real ends and, whatever cool Skype, SVN or the wiki's are, I never forget it's persons what really matter and, even more relevant, the satisfaction of an accepted paper or a new project is not a replacement for the print-leaving feeling you experience when six prople get out of their day-to-day lives for a few hours to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Tomorroww I'll shave and then catch the plane. In my bag I'll carry "Confieso que he vivido" with me; my sneakers, however do not fit in anymore but theirplace is filled with the names of all the people that, thoughout the last tenmonths, have made me feel "thank you" has way too few letters. Tomorrow I'll shave and then catch the plane.</p>
