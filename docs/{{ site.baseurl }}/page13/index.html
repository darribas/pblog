          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So this morning got on a plane again. Pretty early, as usual, and pretty tired, as usual too, again <em>hitting the road</em>. I've found (again) an excuse good enough to spend some (more) time away from my beloved ones; this time I will spend four months at the Department of Spatial Economics of the Free University of Amsterdam (Netherlands) pushing forward my dissertation and whatever else tomorrow brings up. I'm totally braindead right now, after fliying, carrying my three bags around all day and fixing a little bit my new home, but somehow <a href="http://www.looptrooprockers.com/video-promoe-mammas-gata-feat-timbuktu-supreme-andreas-grega/">this</a> song has got me writing...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sort of feel like travelling again. A month ago, when I got back from India all I wanted was to find a little peace of mind and rest of planes, airports, continents, time lags and new things; just some time in an evironment I knew very well with people to whom I didn't have to explain anything because they knew it before I'd open my mouth. That's been pretty much my August: (almost) no planes, family, friends and my hometown. But this is a luxury I think I can't afford right now. I feel like <em>I have to go</em> out there again, discover and live more because tomorrow might be too late or might just not be. So here I am, while all my friends are clebrating one of them's birthday, I'm in front of a window where the white apple of my laptop reflects and beyond which there's a whole great city waiting with more adventures to come. But that starts tomorrow, now I'm off, bed calls...</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So, after a couple of really hectic days learning why India is becoming one of the main countries in the world (and also teaching a workshop to realize it...), we've taken off Bangalore this after-noon and landed in Mumbai at 5 pm. After 2 hours in a cab to make the less than 10 Km to the hotel we've found out the place we had booked turns out to be a little bit different from what we expected (it's actually a pretty western place with most of what I don't like of it but anyway...). Tomorrow we'll try to see a bit of this huge monster called Mumbai and at the end of the day, we'll head to the airport to take the flight back to Europe. Then connection to Madrid, bus and finally home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So many amazing stuff that's changed many views and strength some others, but getting into the details is something for later on when I'm back, I make some sense out of this whole thing and  I can meet you for a coffee or a beer and tell you. By now, it's time to try to find a local place to have a bite of real India...</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">After three days in the middle of a 1100m. high tea plantation trying to understand why elephants hit human settlements from time to time, to set up a woorkshop pretty much from scratch and to ignore the fact that it seems someone up there forgot to close the tap and it's pouring down like crazy (some call it monsoon), tomorrow we are heading to Bangalore to teach the actual workshop on wednesday and thursday (tuesday is all for prep).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These have been a mix of the almost stressing peace you find here, the actual stress of seeing the workshop coming and not having it ready and the joy and greatness of all the learning we are doing and the people we are meeting. Pix and more to come but by now I just wanted the world know I'm still alive and safe at the end of it. The next days will be pretty hectic with all the preparation and workshop, but being here, surrounded by all the wildlife sounds once darkness has taken over, it feels hard to get into that mood of action and  movement...</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Last sunday, after a very hectic week in Barcelona at the SEA meeting and then in the Pyrenees, I got on a bus to Madrid Barajas at 3am; 4  hours later I was taking off to Munich where I had a great day visiting the main spots of the city. A day after we took a connection flight to Frankfurt and then took off to Mumbai. Seven hours later we tried to get to the hotel (1.5 Km away from the airport) and it took us good 20 minutes due to the moonson rain that was pouring. It's 3am on a monday and all I can think of is getting some sleep because we are at the destination yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8am of wednesday, the wake-up call from reception sounds and gotta get on move again. Back to the airport (now in the domestic flights terminal), a few security controls, normal wait and we're on the air again on our way to Coimbatore, where the airport is not more than a small building where you get your luggages out of the cart that brings them from the plane. There we meet Shankar, our host, who takes us for a great meal and then to the Valparai plateau, where we'll spend the next four days. The drive goes through many small villages crowed with people, animals, small houses that seem about to crumble and big Vodafone signs. The landscape is amazing and I just feel like if the car window was a TV showing a wildlife documentarry. After a couple of hours of that, we start going uphill and nature gets wilder: the plain gets substituted by the jungle where only the road gives a little of open space. At the top, the tea plantation domains but I'm so tired I can just see the guest house where they are hosting us and the bed inside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ten minutes of drive from there is Valparai and the field station of the team we work with. From there you can see the tea plantation and the curtain of rain that seems to be part of this landscape as much as the trees or the tea leaves. There is where I write this piece of information from and, afer 10 hours of sleep, this starts looking much better...</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">June 26, 2009</span>  <br/>
          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">For whatever reason, I hadn't open this pad in too long; it was even about to get lost in the last moving out. For any cause, I was about to buy into the idea that writing myself out was something for "whenever you have some spare time". But I just hung my old Vans on a power wire, and I can't think of anything more poetic other than giving "Confieso que he vivido" by P. Neruda to someone who leaves to find on the road. Tomorrow I'll shave and then catch the plane, and I'm pretty sure, from that moment on, work and everything else waiting for me at home will weight enough so as not to keep on top these pieces of lived poetry I'm trying to put in words.</p>
<p>We live in such a digital world, where distances are often but anecdotes and where the possibilities of exchange are such that not giving it a try sounds like really stupid. Yet I hope means don't keep me away from the real ends and, whatever cool Skype, SVN or the wiki's are, I never forget it's persons what really matter and, even more relevant, the satisfaction of an accepted paper or a new project is not a replacement for the print-leaving feeling you experience when six prople get out of their day-to-day lives for a few hours to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Tomorroww I'll shave and then catch the plane. In my bag I'll carry "Confieso que he vivido" with me; my sneakers, however do not fit in anymore but theirplace is filled with the names of all the people that, thoughout the last tenmonths, have made me feel "thank you" has way too few letters. Tomorrow I'll shave and then catch the plane.</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Por la razon que sea, no habia abierto este cuaderno en demasiado tiempo; incluso estuvo a punto de perderse  en la ultima mudanza. Por algun motivo, ya casi estaba convencido que es de escribir lo que llevas dentro era algo para "cuando tienes tiempo". Pero acabo de colgar mis viejas Vans en un cable de la luz, y lo unico mas poetico que se me ocurre ahora es regalar "Confieso que he vivido" de Neruda a alguien que parte para encontrar en el camino. Manana me afeito y despues cojo el avion, y estoy seguro de que, a partir de ese momento, el trabajo y todo lo que me espera en casa pesaran demasiado como para dejar a flote estos retazos de poesia vivida a los que intento dar palabras.</p>
<p>Vivimos en un mundo digital en que la distancias es muchas veces mera anecdota, en que las posibilidades de intercambio entre personas de diferentes rincones del planeta son tales que no intentarlo suena a estupidez. Aun asi, espero que los medios no me desvien nunca del fin y que, por muy fantastico que sea Skype, SVN o las wikis, no me olvide nunca que lo que de verdad cuenta son las personas y, mas importante, que la satisfaccion de un articulo aceptado o un nuevo proyecto no reemplaza la sensacion de dejar huella que sientes cuando seis personas salen de sus rutinas para decir adios.</p>
<p>Manana me afeito y cojo el avion. En mi bolsa de viaje llevare conmigo, orgulloso, "Confieso que he vivido"; mis zapatillas, sin embargo, ya no entran en la maleta, pero su lugar lo llenan los nombres de todas las personas que, durante estos diez meses, me han hecho sentir que "gracias" tiene demasiadas pocas letras. Manana me afeito y cojo el avion.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">April 20, 2009</span>  <br/>
          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Just back from a weekend in Santa Barbara (re)visitting Charlie with the GeoDa crew. It's been terrific; not only the weather couldn't have been better in that beautiful corner of the world but the circumstances and some of the conversations we´ve had (enhanced by a few beers and a couple of bars) have made me realize how lucky I can feel of being sharing parts of the <em>road</em> with these guys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This year is something really special for me in so many ways; the set of ideas, lifestyles and mindsets I´m being exposed to is making an effect on me I think (hope) will last for long. Also, I'm discovering parts of me and aspects of travelling I didn't expect I'd encounter. For the first real time, this' coming at a cost sometimes, as it's not always as happy as Canada, as exotic as Korea or as perfect as Sweden. But like someone'd say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TANSTAAFL"><em>there's no free lunch</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know I haven't written much about it here, and I'm afraid this' not <em>gonna </em>change in the short run at least. I don't know if I'm getting worse in putting my feelings down on a paper, it they (my feelings) are getting too complex for me to really understand them so as to write about them or just that I'm still too close to the <em>tree so as to be able to picture the forest</em>, but the truth is I don't get the right words. That doesn't mean I'm not <em>feeling</em> or I'm giving up on keeping track of my own life and way; not at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was thinking how I could give those interested a sense of what I'm going through and, as many other times in many other situations, the right answer is <strong>music</strong>. Songs have the power to connect people, points in time and experiences in a way that very few other things I'm aware of can do. As a music-addict, what I listen to probably tells more about me and my state of mind that any other thing. If you think like that and get curious, you can take a look to the last tunes that came through my ears on my <a href="http://www.lastfm.es/user/dreamessence">last.fm profile</a>. But part of the magic of songs is also that they sometimes <em>do get your feelings perfectly</em> unveiled, even when the author wasn't thinking of you while writing the lyrics or doesn't even know you exist at all (most likely). Taking advantage of such property, here're just three tunes that really encapsulate what I'm going through these days. I hope you like them, feel free to post <em>your</em> own current soundtracks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="http://www.looptrooprockers.com/music/Growingupontheroad.mp3"> first one</a> is actually the one that got me writing this post. Very recent stuff from my very most favourite <a href="http://www.looptrooprockers.com/music/Growingupontheroad.mp3">swedish band</a>.</li>
</ul>
<pre style="text-align:center;">(...) I remember when it felt like we had no agenda
no plans had a pad and a pen but
still it felt like we freestyled with life
improvised living on the b-side of life
like our lives was a hidden gem
all those things you had to mattered little then
so young seeing through all those games we play
and i still kind of feel the same way today
(...)</pre>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31WFa51c4Lk">The second one</a> goes for all spanish speakers. Really positive stuff that really reminds me how lucky I am for being able to be living this moment:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="text-align:center;">Y conseguí mi sueño, gracias a mi inconformismo,
 se que muchos enEspaña no pueden decir lo mismo,
 pasta, egocentrismo, su espejismo no me acuna,
 trabajo en mi pasión, esa es mi fortuna.
Y se que no hay vacuna pa esta enfermedad,
 pero estoy contento, 
hice las pases con migran enemigo el tiempo,
 hoy vivir de esta libreta es oro, lo corroboro,
colaboro, y hago bolos por el globo (...)</pre>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-YbW01w4sA">The third one</a> is also spanish, not that positive and I guess it's the other side of the coin. For all the times I felt those lyrics even before I knew they were writen, and for all the nights I've played it over and over on my headphones while trying to fall asleep and thus getting rid of that feeling of loneliness and <em>far</em>-<em>ness</em>, this song's made its way to the top 3.</li>
</ul>
<pre style="text-align:center;">(...)
ni si ganas ni si pierdes,
dinero, mujeres, nada compara si la soledad te muerde
he visto mucha pasta y mucha necesidad
he visto sitios donde las canas salen solo de entrar
Acuérdate bien, siempre, si vives dignamente,
da gracias, dale de comer bien a tu gente (...)</pre>
<ul>
<li>And this list would be unfinished if I didn't add <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nVugP6-_8">this one</a> here; because I always keep it in my mind, because it's been rounding my head ever since I discovered it, because I bring it on whenever I feel the <em>weird one</em>, the outlier, and makes me feel better. And because...</li>
</ul>
<pre style="text-align:center;"> I mean, I love to travel, I hate to fly,
I want to go, but hate goodbyes...</pre>
