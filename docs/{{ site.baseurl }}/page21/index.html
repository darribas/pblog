          <div><div>There's surely no doubt, all over my life music has been as the curtain of many memmories. A few days ago, I was wandering the net and found out <a href="http://popagandhi.com/710/move-to-bremerton/">this post</a>. It's sth I had though so many times I guess it was the perfect excuse to start my own music life-cartography. Here I paste it. Of course, there are some important tunes missing, but those showing up here are part of myself: just random moments shaping a way to see the world. How about you guys?</div>
<div>" <em>15)I start listening to sweet reggae a bit more seriously than I had been, but even today the old Bob keeps defining myself in “Soul Rebel” (bob Marley).</em><em></em></div>
<div><em>17) Could have been either Pennywise, NoFX, or even blink-182, but the perfect combination to me of happy punk-rock and positiveness to life of Millenconlin just made my youth a better time to live:)</em></div>
<div>
<p><em>19)I’ve already made my way to the university, and breakdancing is at its peak time in my scale of preferences… no doubt that was partly due to Dj Shadow and his “Organ Donnor”.</em></p>
<p><em>22)Just that flight by my own would have been enough, but one more year living in Sweden after it makes sure the tune of my early twenties is swedish Lopptroop's "Fly away" ( I even got it tattoed on my feet later…).</em></p>
<p><em>23)Here I am, i’ve already landed one month ago in seoul and, while leaving it on my way back to Spain, I guess the only way i can find to get a bit of peace in the middle of this stream of planes, symbols i don’t know at all and feeling-rollercoasters is to go really back to the roots of beauty and plug my ears to Satie's piano and his Gymnopedie Nr. 1.</em>"</p>

          <div><div align="justify">After a loooooooooong wait for uploading the pix (don't know if due to my connection, to some problems in my Ubuntu or to the Picasa's beta version), here is the link to the pix from Morocco. As I said it's been such a great trip: really delicious food, amazing landscapes and such lovely people (both locals and folks). Seriously, for a (southern) European Morocco is the easiest way to get to a very different place (sometimes I felt a bit like being in an taiwanese night market but for men faces...) within the standard European flight distance and by exploiting low-cost companies. Go there before it's too late!!!</div>
<div align="justify">It's also been a nice opportunity to meet some spanish friends from Sweden, share tea-cups, chat with them and get to know about their lives now almost 2 years have passed since the big Circus came to an end. Yet one more thing, this trip has given me the opportunity to discover a bit more about how International Cooperation for development is carried out in real world (my friend is working for the spanish agency for international cooperation) as well as the chance to meet really interesting people and unusual life-paths. Still learning a lot on the road!!!</div>

          <div><p>Trying to type this from a half french half arabic keyboard which is driving me crazy... so do not expect that much. Arriving was easier than expected, landing, and train by myself straight to Rabat, where Clara waited for me. Following day, the rest of the team came and ze headed down to Marraketch: 2 days full of tagine, narrow streets and soooo much mint tea, XD. On monday, we hopped on a 4x4 which took us to the Erg Chebbi, raw Sahara. Today we came back from the desert and stopped by Ouazarzate; where I type this from. Week is being great, really amazing and plenty of new experiences. I will post more and more deeply as soon as I get back to my beloved QWERTY.</p>
<p>Mom&amp;Dad, I ll be safe and sound and I expect to be back home on tuesday night, i ll call u as soon as I land in Spain.</p>
