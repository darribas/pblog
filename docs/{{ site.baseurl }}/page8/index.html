      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1826793">Concrete Desert</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/262123">Jon Talton</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/258832409">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      I started reading 'Concrete Desert' at Lux Cafe on Central Av. (Phoenix) on a saturday morning and by sunday night I had finished it. For someone who's never been to Phoenix, the book will look no more (and no less) than a good thriller story with the twist of a PhD in history involved in it. Something like a book version of an episode of Cold Case that you can easily imagine turned into a movie; an American version of Millenium where the cold Swedish snow has been traded for the equally extreme July heat of the Valley of the Sun.</p>
<p>But for those whose life has somehow crossed the city, the book will uncover a rare extra layer of sense of place; it'll sketch a city overwhelmed by its own growth but that not very long ago was a small desert town in a remote place of which Evil didn't seem to be aware of. Clearly written by a native who grew up along with the suburban machine, Concrete Desert shows the local aspect of the city with probably the least "localness" of the world. And that in itself is worth much more than the dollar that Amazon will charge you for reading in on a screen.</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10262159">Seeds</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4591901">Ross Mackintosh</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/272035366">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      As the foreword of the book reads, "cartooning is the art of distilling reality to its essence" and "Seeds" perfectly strips down the painful process that a person and his/her close family undergoes when he/she is diagnosed terminal cancer. </p>
<p>By using endearing drawings, Mackinthosh is able to capture the impotence and despair yet intense humanism of the situation: from the beginning when you try to convince yourself it might not be that severe as you are informed, to the final stages when the body of the person deteriorates by the day, to the first months after the death, when you unsuccessfully try to deal with the absence and understand what it means. </p>
<p>For anyone who unfortunately has had to live an experience like this, the read of Seeds is both unresting because it inevitably brings back memories that might have been put aside but also comforting because it reveals the most human aspect of our inner self, the one that only comes out in extreme situations and makes everything else in life look irrelevant. Very powerful stuff.</p>

          <div><p><span style="text-align:justify;">A few days ago I had to go renew my passport after almost five years of globe-trotting. Because my US visa is there and still active, I was able to keep it and it'll hopefully let me in when I land in Phoenix next tuesday. The truth is I am no collector in general. I'm just too lazy, nomad or inconstant to store items of a kind and keep them with me over time, always having it in mind to buy a new addition when I see the chance. I am however a huge fan of physical objects that represent much more than the grams they weight. And the passport I've been carrying in my bag over the last five years is probably the best collector of memories and other weightless things that I can think of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the bus to my next task that morning, I started flipping through the pages and, before I got to my destination, I had traveled around half the planet. I started on the first page, where a 22-years-old Dani looks like sleepy and unhappy. I remember that spring morning as if it had been last may: I was in a rush to get the passport in time to take off to South Korea and the lady at the desk told me she wouldn't take the picture I had because it was too old, so I had to go take a new one at 8am, hence the outcome. Then as I turned the pages, a stream of flashes started coming to mind in completely out of any chronological order, just the way customs officers put the country stamp when you cross the border. The US, Korea, Taiwan (or Republic of China, as it reads), Chile, Cambodia, Thailand, India, China or Morocco. And these gave rise to all the other ones that don't get to the passport but did leave a stamp on me, like most of Europe or Mexico. I am certainly different today than I was that morning when I was photographed, and I'm sure for the most part it's an improvement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Changing years is an important event because I think it forces us, if only a little bit, to realize time passes, a new spring, summer, fall and winter are to come and hopefully the ones that just went by gave us all something more than a few more grams in the belly or a couple of new gray hairs. In my case, I can only feel fortunate for these incredible twelve months and hope they don't stop when the clock rings the bells tonight, so I'm going to pretend I'm just celebrating the change of passports and that I now have a full set of new pages to be stamped. Cheers for all the new adventures to come, Peace and Love.</p>

      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1728101">The Self-Organizing Economy</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1291">Paul Krugman</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/251718332">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      Very suggesting and thought-provoking, the book was written as a spinoff of conferences Krugman gave, very much in the style of "Geography and Trade" (1992). This means the tone is very informal, making it somehow easier to grasp. He also takes a less serious approach than he would if this was academic writing, so I'd place the book between academic (some of the ideas are not trivial to get) and pop science, as the other review notes.</p>
<p>His main aim is to link some of his earlier economic geography models, adapted to an intra-urban context, with the literature in complexity and emerging systems. To my knowledge it's one of the very few attempts in the direction of giving some economic foundations to many econo-physics ideas applied to cities. Having said that, I don't fully buy the whole idea, I think whenever he gets the closest to complexity (Fourier chains, etc.) he looses the economic background, defeating the purpose a bit; also his tone in some pages, repeating the word "complex" more than he probably should doesn't help and makes you feel he's trying to trick you rather than honestly convincing you. The basic idea however is very appealing and it scratches the surface of a fruitful field, still open today in my opinion.</p>
<p>All in all, the book clearly has Krugman's print at his most academic side in that it's very clearly written and he follows his usual approach of light math and heavy content: don't be misled by its 130 pages, the density of ideas and creativity per page makes them feel much longer. Good reference if you are in need of some extravagant ideas to think outside the mainstream economics box.</p>

The usual suspects show up. Maybe not surprisingly, although right in the middle, 'economics' doesn't appear very big. Comment taken, trying to work my way back into the source of all Truths :-&gt;</p>

      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/207665069">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      The main hypothesis is that several barriers to (re)development in the most productive cities of the US have pushed population to cities with lower densities and productivity, hampering economic growth and performance.</p>
<p>The book is written in the spirit of Glaesser's "Triumph of the city", but has notably less arguments and is focused much more on the aspect of development barriers.</p>
<p>I think the biggest advantage over Glaesser's is the (much smaller) time investment that it requires, it can easily be read on a long flight. The author gives a good sense of the main reasons for economic agglomerations in a tone easily understandable for the general public, and offers a good explanation of why cities are relevant for economic performance, and why their role is increasing with new technological advances.</p>
<p>On the minus side, I agree with the other reviewer in that the main message of this book can be summarized in much less than the already short 90 pages it takes. Also, I might be wrong, but I have the feeling the author sometimes mixes up the concept of density with that of size: some of the economic benefits of agglomeration he mentions (e.g. the Marshallian trinity) relate more to "being big" rather than to "being dense". I think there are sufficient arguments explicitly for density so as to have to steal those from density and not mention it, confusing the reader and giving room to critics of dense cities and compact development.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a decent book to inform the general public.</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Bobbie is now waving her hand as my train from Malmoe (Sweden) to the airport in Copenhagen departs. She is only 3 years old, yet she knows more about globalization than many older people will ever know; her mother is from Sweden and his dad, David, from Spain. David used to be my scouts' instructor and later became one of the biggest inspirations when I started to make the decissions that led to the life I'm currently living. We have been meeting over the years, usually for Christmas when we both return home, but <a href="http://esflog.com/dreamessence/949903">last time</a> I visited him at his place, however, was in the spring of 2006, while I was living in Sweden and finishing my bachelor's.</p>
<p>Five years ago, David was at the beginning of a rare project called <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> nobody else at the time except himself and a few other visionaries really understood; 21 years old Dani was starting to explore what leaving abroad by himself means; and Bobbie, of course, did not exist. This weekend, David was just back from Chicago and getting ready for his two talks about Arduino next week, one of them in Taipei (the project has been featured in <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-11/ff_openmanufacturing?currentPage=all">Wired</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/arts/design/arduinos-provide-interactive-exhibits-for-about-30.html">The New York Times</a>, among others); I was visiting from Amsterdam, where I am spending the summer as a postdoc visitor, in an effort to "keep one foot" in the US and the other one in Europe; and Bobbie is the living realization of the world she has been born in. It only takes the two days I have spent with her to not only completely fall in love with that smile and bright of eyes but to compile a full list of details and facts that sketch her coordinates of life, to name just a few: the obvious ability with which she switches from spanish to swedish and back depending who she talks to; her best friend Nikita, daugther of a swedish woman and a sub-saharian man; or the natural tone she has when speaking of her two homes, one in Malmoe and the other one in Spain, as if they were two rooms of the same house.</p>
<p>As I type these words on the plane, I am now leaving with the same mix of admiration, excitement, unrest and confussion that invades me whenever I meet David. Admiration for he has not stepped down from the category of personal inspiration; excitement for Bobbie and how David is managing to be a world-class <em>geek rockstar</em> and the biggest dad without loosing a bit of his personality; and the unrest and confussion that usually come whenever you find situations and interact with realities that somehow escape your own grasp, when you feel there is an extra layer of complexity beyond what you understand and feel comfortable with that you want to control but you can't. They are probably well founded since, after all, there is nothing more complicated than figuring out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BEnKsGg0_8">magic</a>.</p>
