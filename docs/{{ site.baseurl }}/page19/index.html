          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dreamessence/JustMe/photo#5227179901141362722">here I am</a>, 6:10 am (Spanish time yet), sit in front of the desk number 306 at Barajas Airport waiting for it to open and let me check-in. In a few hours I'll be "hubbin'" in Zurich and, after a few more hours, landing at the JFK airport in New York. But before I jump into myself and dive through my feelings, let me do little bit of update: after a weird and feelings-mixed week in Santander, attending a course on history of economic thought at the summer university, I was driven directly to the Pyrenees mountains where, after a few adventures to finally get to the place, I enjoyed one of the most magic nights lately: a reggae concert by a lake, completely surrounded by nature and backed by my very close friends. Just the breath of fresh air I needed in the middle of this crazy time which started a couple of months ago and will finish when I finally settle in Tempe, AZ, by mid-August. After the concert I came back home for the last week, where the clock was not slow enough to let me fit within that time all the things, people and events I wanted to meet. However, I think I did all the paperwork I needed to, I met a good bunch of friends I won't till Christmas and even got some uni-work done.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Back to the desk at the airport, it sounds like it should feel like Something starting or Something coming to an end; at least a break point. But actually it doesn't. Unlike in Sweden, where I was expecting the take-off for a long time before it happened, these last days at home have been many things but waiting for something to come: I have tried to delay everything dealing with this trip till the last-minute (I started packing up 3 hours before leaving my room...) and tried to grab "home's joys" while possible. this doesn't imply I won't miss my broad Family (I'm sure I will indeed) but just that I've tried to keep my mind busy so I can't say I didn't seized the moment. Personally, I I'd like to believe it's a sign proving I'm "learning" how to travel and how to leave places where I've been happy: while two years ago I'd start missing places I'd enojyed before I'd left them, now I focus on enjoying them till there's no more to enjoy. Easy to tell, getting easier to do... Yet I can't say I've learned how to say goodbye (still hating them).</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So I got a car. Well, we got a <em>rented</em> car. I had been somehow nervous seeing the day coming closer and closer and not doing anything, but getting more nervous. So on tuesday we decided to finally get rid of this pain. After a really nice italian lunch under some trees as umbrella and an improvised <em>siesta</em> (the heat was really pushing us to the couch) we sat in front of the computer and started scooping rental car websites. After a while, a few shocks due to the numbers we were seeing and some deeper search, we came out with the final choice: a Chevrolet from Alamo through a british web-operator :) I guess it couldn't have been anything better than a <em>Chevie</em> for my Coast2Coast.</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Today we've had the "<em>final</em>" exam. It wasn't really important for the course as we had already got the certificates, but it did foster my will to study and that's a good thing. I didn't go into detail trhough all the proofs and demonstrations which I guess were beyond my both interest and level but I do think it made me learn more, which was the main point of coming to Rome.<br />
Now I'll be here untill thursday (the exams were supposed to take place until wed but for some reason compressed to only today), then I'll fly back to Zgz but just for a short layover before I get on a bus straight down to Madrid where my good friend jorge will host me the night from thursday to friday. Friday morning visa interview, a bit of walk around and I guess I'll stay there till sat that I'll definitely get back home. <em>DreamEssence</em>'s on the move baby, yeah!!!</p>

          <div><div style="text-align:justify;">Tonight, we've had a really nice dinner to celebrate one of the student's birthday. It's taken place at another group of student's place, which turned out to be a really nice apartment in a peaceful and really italian district nearby the university. We ate outside at the terrace tomato and mozarella cheese and chatted for a while. Then I walked by myself back home through the streets of central Rome thinking how nice this opportunity is for me. Not only have I learnt (I still am, indeed) a lot of spatial stuff, but also I've had the chance to meet different people whose only common point is a very rare and specialized field in social science. And whenever very different people meet, there's a huge lot to learn, both about what you like and what you don't like from them; about what you'd like to become and what you'd not. All along this time here, that quote from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Zex1IVVOw"><span style="font-style:italic;">My blueberry nights</span></a> has come to me over and over again, and I think I couldn't put it better myself...</p>

          <div><div style="text-align:justify;">First update after a week without passing by this place... Time here is turning great and almost everyday there's something new to tell about. Anway, I'll try to zoom out and just put down the most relevant <span style="font-style:italic;">highlights</span> of the week. For now, just two of them...</p>
<p>Certainly, I've cut down my amount of walks and pictures, I guess it has to do with the fact I feel more comfortable. Once a friend of mine told me the <span style="font-style:italic;">first</span> days are always somewhat more sad because one tends to feel more lone but they are also those you usually learn the most from. I guess I've already get used to San Lorenzo and somehow Rome and don't feel anymore the need to go out in the street, walk while listening to music and shoot pictures to <span style="font-style:italic;">fill </span>that<span style="font-style:italic;"> "empty space"</span>...</p>
<p>Last week, we had <a href="http://www.econ.umd.edu/~kelejian/">Harry Kelejian</a> for the theoretical part. I did learn a lot about spatial econometrics but specially it was the non-tangible part the best. As we say in Spain, "<span style="font-style:italic;">más sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo</span>" (it'd go something like "devil is wiser because of his age than because of his status as devil"): he is very young in mind but full of experience and I believe that's what really makes the difference when it comes to teaching. Analytical stuff and models themselves can be found in a book or a .pdf (of course it's far better if someone shows you the key parts) but I'm pretty sure the most important and interesting thing I'll keep from the week with Kelejian will be the last one hour and a half he started by saying: "<span style="font-style:italic;">you know, this stuff I'm gonna tell you about is not in the lecture notes, nor in any book, so you can take it as an extra for your own human capital...</span>"</div>
