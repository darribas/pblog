You need someone who can remember it all. And that means Lucy. And you know what else? You have to get that data in the first place. Records, documents, files, probably restricted files at that.

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Last week, at the 53rd ERSA conference in Palermo, I had the pleasure to see Professor Masahisa Fujita deliver his keynote speech. In his last slide, he paid a tribute to German economist August Losch, one of the pioneers in introducing space into economic analysis and a person with a fascinating life. For my records, I'll copy here the first paragraph of the epilogue in his book "<a href="http://archive.org/details/economicsoflocat00ls"><em>Economics of Location</em></a>". Very powerfull stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If everything occurred at the same time there would be no development. If everything existed in the same place there could be no particularity. Only space makes possible the particular, which then unfolds in time. Only because we are not equally near to everything; only because everything does not rush in upon us at once; only because our world is restricted, for every individual, for his people, and for mankind as a whole, can we, in our finiteness, endure at all. The extent of this horizon differs, of course, from man to man. But in economic affairs, as in all other affairs, our ken is limited for acting intelligently and for finding our way through the complexities of life. And even within this little world, we are familiar with not more than its innermost circle. Depth must be bought with narrowness. Space creates and protects us in this limitation. Particularity is the price of our existence.</p>

      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/414782428">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      I've been using Python for quantitaive economics and geography for the last five years and I wish this book had been written back then. It is clear, easy to read, full of (cool) examples and incredibly useful, regardless of whether you read it from first to last page or have it around to check while hacking. If you are getting started on data crunching with Python, you should not miss it. If you are not new to the party, this will still be a good resource to get your head around a bit more advanced pandas, and the chapter on advanced Numpy is very informative too.</p>
<p>However, if you are over most of the learning curve, the book has a different feel. Although the title might suggest different, "Python for Data Analysis" is mostly "Pandas for Data Analysis". Fair enough, if you've written the library itself, it seems appropriate to focus on it, but I think it should be stressed from the beginning. Other crucial elements of the Python data stack (matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn...) are sometimes touched upon, but only briefly, and only to the extent you can relate them to pandas. I would have enjoyed it much more if those were covered a bit more in detail. Still, very good book.</p>

<p>      The book is a little slow and sleep-inducing if you're not "in the mood" for something like it. Expect less cartography and geography than philosophy and reflection. Although,  in its true meaning, not in the technical task of drawing boundaries, the job of a cartographer is much more about the latter than it is about the former. </p>
<p>I have particularly appreciated the discussion about subjectivity in the way we perceive and understand the world and the relevance of being open and ready to change one's view in some cases, throwing away or previous understanding and embracing someone else's if it looks more convincing. At least, making the effort to switch to "the other"'s position.  Ironic but powerful that a message to reject dogma in favor of reason comes from a Christian monk, but I guess that's what the Renaissance was about.</p>

      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/607075883">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      Exquisite short book that makes for a longer read because you want to hold on to it for as long as you can. In a series of short stories, Ehrlich narrates her experiences in Wyoming while working in a ranch. The book is beautifully written but, as a non-native english speaker, it does contain some passages/words a bit too hard.</p>
<p>I've always felt an inexplicable attraction for remote places, far landscapes and wild harsh nature, and this book encapsulates those three perfectly. Based on her own experiences, Ehrlich's reflects on ranchers, sheepherders, cowboys, native americans, and how they understand, repect and interact with their environment. Particularly inspiring are her views on human-animal and human-nature interactions, on which the usual either over-romantic or over-cruel view is absent. Her sober but powerful, first-person, account is probably the most appealing aspect of the book.</p>
