          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">So, after ten days on the road (Vegas for a conference + the Grand Canyon and Santa Barbara + LA for fun), I finally got back home last weekend. It was a really great and fun time realizing how beautiful this part of the Earth can be and having great times with old and not that old friends... Vegas was good enough for once, but I don't think I'll be back to that place for a long (not my style at all; the Grand Canyon was... grand; Santa Barbara was gorgeous, I got to run and ride a bike and it was really beautiful, plus the host was just perfect; and LA was the best end for that week, checking out how's life for my man Ago around a few rolls of sushi@the sushi house, as it's becoming a tradition every time I pass by town. Here are the pictures of the great days:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All in all, it was a great break off work but now it's over. I got to Tempe last sunday and the past week has been a sort of lost one: I fell sick so I couldn't do much but let time go by... Anyway I think I'm feeling better now so hopefully next week will be the real come back, start up and speed up of things. Time's running out and I <em>gotta </em>run faster!!!</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">For a long time, I've been meaning to get back to my hobby of taking pictures and alking around human places. Finally, las sunday, I managed to grab my camera when the sun was about to go down, in that moment of the day when the light is just magic, and go out for a walk. I just went through the same streets I pass by every morning, but it's amazing how much you miss when you don't walk! Serve yourself, I hope you enjoy them...</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Right when I'm getting done with my adventure on <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/node/285">kangaroos</a>, here it comes the next one! This time is not about writing a paper about the farthest away from home country but about actually going somewhere. The <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu">GeoDa Center</a> I'm visiting this year is starting now to work and collaborate with the <a href="http://www.ncf-india.org/">Nature Conservation Foundation</a> in India; the main purpose is to try to bring spatial analysis tools into wildlife conservation to help understand and manage the relationship between humans and animals. It is meant to be a long term relationship with a lot of results expected, but one of the first steps made to start walking down this road is the celebration of a two-day long workshop on spatial analysis and techniques for grad students and scholars to take place at the <a href="http://www.ncbs.res.in/">NCBS</a> in Bangalore in July. I was offered to be part of the <em>team</em> which will go into the field and teach the course and, before the offer was ended, I had already said yes. So, if all goes as expected, <strong>next July 14th. I'll get on a plane to Mumbay</strong> and spend 10 days in one of the countries which for a long time was on my <em>to-go</em> list but never actually found a good excuse for. Teaching at one of the cutting-edge centers for biological sciences in India seems like a good one, doesn't it?</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">I've been working on and behind this idea for quile a long time, but it hasn't been till these late days that it hasn't come through, so I didn't wanna post anything till now. Anyway, here is the official announcement: it  all seems to point to <strong>me spending four months from September to December 2009 at the Department of Spatial Economics of the Free University in Amsterdam</strong>. Same as I'm doing now at the <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu">GeoDa Center</a>, I'd spend four months in the capital of the Netherlands writing part of my dissertation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is certainly of great excitement for me to have the chance to live for a short while in one of the most beautiful cities I've evere been to, one of the most bike-friendly and one where I still keep very good friends from my days in Sweden (not only there but also very closeby). Considering life  outside the university here in the desert, and how much I like European cities, it will be a fantastic experience to wander and discover all the tiny coffee shops, small and cute streets and the channals. And last, but not least at all, it won't be the paperwork nightmare the US was now about a year ago, which is something I'm coming to appreciate :) I can't wait for that!!!</p>

          <!--
          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">I just got back home after a weekend in California: on friday I got on a plane to LA where Ago was waiting me to take for a drink and later for dinner; I think there are moments to make history and others to remember it and, if you manage to combine both in the right composition, it's perfect. This one was one of them to remember and so we did around tons of great and cheap sushi in my already preferred place in LA, a very small and humble restauran run by five japanese where decoration barely exists but reggae is in the air and sushi is delicious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As we say in Spain " good, if short, is double good", the following morning I got up real early and headed over the airport to continue my "revival" tour: it was time to San Francisco and the great times and people spent in Korea now a year and a half ago. A couple of koreans from the summer school happened to be in the city and we arranged a weekend there, so Katie would come up from Orange county and I'd go from AZ. It was really short and unplanned but the only fact that it happened already made me happy. We ate tons of asian food and sweets and chatted all over the weekend; I spent the night at my friend Jesus' place and this morning, after mexican breakfast, I got on a plane, again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It's been really short, just like a dream, just like memories are, they come and go and the meantime in between is what really matters and makes life great; but it's been the perfect way to forget about the desert and work for a while and, considering the month now just finishes (coming back from Spain, moving to the new apartment, rushing to finish work with no success...), it was just perfect. Here are the pics although there are not that many; I usually get very lazy about taking pictures, specially when people I am with have cameras (not difficult if you are with four asians...). Anyway, serve yourself:</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">Just trying to update the picture storage in here. Right before coming back home for Christmas, the great David invited us to a tamale-making party at this place. Tamales are typical mexican food based on corn hash, meat and fat (alright, I didn't say much to differenciate it...) which are usually made at that part of the year. We gathered something like ten folks and worked cooperatively (hereby the joke of "kibutz") to make up to 400 of them in a few hours. Here is the proof:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, during the month back home, I had the chance to travel to the (my beloved) Pyrenees a couple of times; one with the family and the other one to visit Angel, a friend of mine who's actually living and working up there in Sallent de Gallego. One of those mornings I grabbed my camera and went off for a walk, here is a little bit what it looked like:</p>

          <div><p style="text-align:justify;">I know I've been pretty absent for the last two months, but I guess a pretty crazy month back home for Christmas and a really hectic back to the desert with the <em>post-Chistmas depression</em> and a paper to be re-done make up for a good excuse, if that can be accepted :)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Christmas back home was good, pretty stressing and with some sad parts, but it was nice overall. Meeting friends, eating good and travelling around the beautiful part of this world where I belong. What else can I ask for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, I just wanted to drop a few lines to update my life for those interested:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>I've moved from the house where I lived during fall to a much closer one and it's turning out to have been a very good decission, now I live in a smaller place but way closer to "life" (it's closer to the uni and to downtown), which is good when you don't have a car.</li>
<li>I've arranged a trip to California for next weekend: I'll fly out on friday to LA, have dinner with Ago and spend the night there and, on saturday morning, I'll get on a plane to SF to have remember weekend with some friend I made in Korea. I'l post the pics and more once back home.</li>
<li>I've missed home like hell and I've (am) worked my ass right off.</li>
<li>And I'm still learning and happy...</li>
