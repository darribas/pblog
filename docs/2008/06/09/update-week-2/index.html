      <h1>Update: week 2</h1>
<p class="subtitle">June 9, 2008</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">First update after a week without passing by this place... Time here is turning great and almost everyday there's something new to tell about. Anway, I'll try to zoom out and just put down the most relevant <span style="font-style:italic;">highlights</span> of the week. For now, just two of them...</p>
<p>Certainly, I've cut down my amount of walks and pictures, I guess it has to do with the fact I feel more comfortable. Once a friend of mine told me the <span style="font-style:italic;">first</span> days are always somewhat more sad because one tends to feel more lone but they are also those you usually learn the most from. I guess I've already get used to San Lorenzo and somehow Rome and don't feel anymore the need to go out in the street, walk while listening to music and shoot pictures to <span style="font-style:italic;">fill </span>that<span style="font-style:italic;"> "empty space"</span>...</p>
<p>Last week, we had <a href="http://www.econ.umd.edu/~kelejian/">Harry Kelejian</a> for the theoretical part. I did learn a lot about spatial econometrics but specially it was the non-tangible part the best. As we say in Spain, "<span style="font-style:italic;">m√°s sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo</span>" (it'd go something like "devil is wiser because of his age than because of his status as devil"): he is very young in mind but full of experience and I believe that's what really makes the difference when it comes to teaching. Analytical stuff and models themselves can be found in a book or a .pdf (of course it's far better if someone shows you the key parts) but I'm pretty sure the most important and interesting thing I'll keep from the week with Kelejian will be the last one hour and a half he started by saying: "<span style="font-style:italic;">you know, this stuff I'm gonna tell you about is not in the lecture notes, nor in any book, so you can take it as an extra for your own human capital...</span>"</div>
