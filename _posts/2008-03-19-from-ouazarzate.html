<p>Trying to type this from a half french half arabic keyboard which is driving me crazy... so do not expect that much. Arriving was easier than expected, landing, and train by myself straight to Rabat, where Clara waited for me. Following day, the rest of the team came and ze headed down to Marraketch: 2 days full of tagine, narrow streets and soooo much mint tea, XD. On monday, we hopped on a 4x4 which took us to the Erg Chebbi, raw Sahara. Today we came back from the desert and stopped by Ouazarzate; where I type this from. Week is being great, really amazing and plenty of new experiences. I will post more and more deeply as soon as I get back to my beloved QWERTY.</p>
<p>Mom&amp;Dad, I ll be safe and sound and I expect to be back home on tuesday night, i ll call u as soon as I land in Spain.</p>
