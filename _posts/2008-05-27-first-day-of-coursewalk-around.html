<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div style="text-align:justify;">Today I started the course by having the presentation, then a couple of hours of spatial statistics and finally 3 hours of location theory. Apart from the academic side (not that much so far as it was only the begining, so still <span style="font-style:italic;">tracktable</span>), we got to know lunch and dinner is covered by the course fee, which will cut down the food expenditure and will allow us to go luxury when it comes to ice-creams...

<p>By 7:00pm we were done with classes had already had dinner. My flatmates wanted to go home but, since the day was just perfect, I felt <span style="font-style:italic;">the call of Rome</span>. So I dropped the class-stuff, plugged my ears to my headphones, where a blended mix of "<span style="font-style:italic;">My Blueberry Nights'</span>" OST, CC's "<span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings</span>" and Maria Callas' "<span style="font-style:italic;">Best of</span>" was spinning around, grabbed my camera and went for a walk which ended up (as usual) in getting lost then found thanks to the kindness of people and to a bus this time. Here are the results you can see (the more important outcome of the walk cannot be shown as it's only in my mind, much more peaceful now I guess...). Enjoy them.</p>
