<div style="text-align:justify;">Tonight, we've had a really nice dinner to celebrate one of the student's birthday. It's taken place at another group of student's place, which turned out to be a really nice apartment in a peaceful and really italian district nearby the university. We ate outside at the terrace tomato and mozarella cheese and chatted for a while. Then I walked by myself back home through the streets of central Rome thinking how nice this opportunity is for me. Not only have I learnt (I still am, indeed) a lot of spatial stuff, but also I've had the chance to meet different people whose only common point is a very rare and specialized field in social science. And whenever very different people meet, there's a huge lot to learn, both about what you like and what you don't like from them; about what you'd like to become and what you'd not. All along this time here, that quote from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Zex1IVVOw"><span style="font-style:italic;">My blueberry nights</span></a> has come to me over and over again, and I think I couldn't put it better myself...</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-style:italic;">"Sometimes, we depend on other people as a mirror to define us and tell us who we are, and each reflection make me like myself a little more.</span>"</p>
