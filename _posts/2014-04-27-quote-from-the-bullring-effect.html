<blockquote>Those of us who have grown up in the city know that what is at Birmingham’s heart is not easily definable. It’s a quality that sits somewhere between eclecticism and incoherence, stubbornness and ambition, self-awareness and self-sacrifice. Oddly enough, the Bullring does seem to represent these qualities. Not in an easy-on-the-eye marketable fashion. Rather, in its mix of public and commercial interests, its reversal of the indoors, its potentially self-destructive approach to the markets and a fluctuating physical presence, the Bullring captures the city’s contradictions as lived by its inhabitants.</p>
