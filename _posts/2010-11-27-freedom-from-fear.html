<p style="text-align:justify;">On this morning bike ride (mostly on non-wehicule trail), I listened to PRI's "The Changing World" podcast, a series of documentaries about global issues, very interesting topics usually. <a href="http://www.podcastdirectory.com/podshows/8540726">Today's show </a>was on <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, Burmese freedom activist and Nobel Peace Price laureate, who's been under one way or another of arrest for the last 20 years (currently under house arrest by the militar goverment of the country). It's about half an hour of very powerful and strong stuff. I'll post here the quote that made me drop a couple of tears of joy (I'll claim it was the cold that made it for the public record...) while pedalling, the rest is left for you to dig it up.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I am happy because I am free, free from fear..."</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">Aung San Suu Kyi</p>
</blockquote>
