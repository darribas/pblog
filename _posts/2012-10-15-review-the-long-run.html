      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12978407">The Long Run</a> by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4805000">Mishka Shubaly</a><br />
      My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/434474724">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>      "The long run" is a short read. Not only because it's only about 60 digital pages but because once you start the first word, the next one comes natural all the way till the end of the story. Shubaly's account of his journey into alcoholic hell and back as an extreme runner is full of the traditional "sex, drugs and rock'n'roll", but also filled with humiliation, regret and honesty in telling how recovery has come to him.</p>
<p>I found out about the book thanks to his telling of "Shipwrecked" at The Moth podcast and that night started reading "The long run" right away. I put it down when I couldn't keep my eyes open any more, but first thing I did the morning after was finishing. And there's got to be something interesting enough to keep me away from breakfast.</p>
