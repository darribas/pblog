<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm finally in Rome. I got here today after a crazy and really fast friday fixing everything for the US visa, a farewell dinner with my friends from the uni, party night, shower (notice i didn't mention sleep) and a 2 hours plane-sleep. Ago picked me up@the airport (thanks god) and took me "home" where I dropped the luggage and headed for a slide of pizza (Italian food rules).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So far, really good weather and a nice area next to the uni, not much more. More to come after I get a real sleep, rest and puzzle out all the feelings and thoughts running around right now... it's been too much in too little time.</p>
