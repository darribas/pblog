<blockquote>"A good rodeo, like a good marriage, or musical instrument when played to the pitch of perfection, becomes more than what it started out to be. It is effort transformed into effortlessness; a balance becomes grace, the way love goes deep into friendship."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>The solace of open spaces"</em>Â  G. Ehrlich.</p>
