<p style="text-align:justify;">So, after a lot of thinking, it's decided: as from today on, <strong>I stop travelling</strong>. No more planes, no more buses, no more sleeping on somebody else's couch, no more passport checks, no more meeting new wonderful people from all over the world, no more discovering new places, no more changing country every other month, no more new delicious food you can always taste in certain places of the world. I am fed up, I stop. That was it.</p>
