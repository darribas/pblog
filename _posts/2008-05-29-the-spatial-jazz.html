<div style="text-align:justify;">One of the things I like the most about going for a month to a city, not specially for tourism, is the possibility to: first, get to know locals in a better way (not only taking one as a touristic target to exploit); second, to have the freedom to do things you'd probably never do if you were in the city because they belong to that group of things you may do <span style="font-style:italic;">everywhere</span>. Another nice point of the course I'm attending this month is the <span style="font-style:italic;">social event</span>, which takes place once a week. Today it was turn for Jazz@<a href="http://www.alexanderplatz.it/">Alexander Platz Jazz Club</a>, the oldest one in Italy. Here I drop the pix, not many this time as I was more focused on the music. As a jazz-lover, I enjoyed it very much :)</div>
