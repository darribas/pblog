<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear Spatial Analysis community:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a by-product of last summer's <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/node/661" target="_blank">Workshop in India</a>, the GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation has started a new<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spatial_analysis_software" target="_blank"> WikiPedia page to list Spatial Analysis Software</a>. As it is now, it is just a beginning with a small subset of it, but the goal is to end up with a <strong>comprehensive list of packages written to enable spatial analysis</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is structured as a sortable table with the following columns: 'Package' (name), 'Free of charge' (yes/no), 'Operating Systems' (platform), 'Developer Institution/person', 'Website' (link to the projects page), 'Field of interest (if any specific)', 'Main Features', 'Language' (programming language use), 'License' (in order to know degree of freedom in the code).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To edit, just click on the tab 'edit this page' on the top of the page and edit. All the changes go live, so make sure you want to do that change before clicking on "Save changes". If you want to add a new package (row in the table), it is recommended to copy and paste the block of an existing one and edit the new one there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We would like to invite you all to take a look at it and help improve it. The beginning of the page is like pushing a snowball from the top of the hill, what it is to come will be up to the community!</p>
