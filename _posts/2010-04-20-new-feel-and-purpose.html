<p style="text-align:justify;">Lately this blog has been devoted pretty much only to quick updates or samples of thought about my late travels. However, social networks (<a href="http://twitter.com/darribas">e.g.</a> or <a href="http://twitxr.com/dreamessence/">e.g.</a>) have seen me pretty active lately, which kind of expresses my will to be heard <em>out there</em>; they came when I was starting to feel bored of the rigidity of the blog and I quickly embraced its instanteneity, ubiquity, and pretty much any other kind of 'ity' you can think of. However, I don't think they are perfect. Although I like how much they lower the barriers to jump from simple content-consumption to content-creation, and I believe expressing yourself smartly in 140 characters can be a sort of an art, sometimes the contraction of words and thinking it requires counteracts. Moreover, the fact that it allows you to post so much stuff, from a random thought to a cool article you came across, devalues each post as it becomes a smaller portion of the total. Because of all that (and because I came across a functionality that allows you to post by mail here and have it distributed on twitter and facebook), I've decided to (try to) re-activate this blog in the form of more regular, smaller posts that encapsulate everything I can't fit in 140 characters and still think it's worth posting. Let's see how far I get.</p>
