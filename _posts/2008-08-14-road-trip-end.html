<div style="text-align:justify;">So this morning, around 12:00 we've crossed the Golden Gate building and the road-trip has come to an end. It's been two weeks and a half of joy, full of fun and where I've also learnt a lot about different things. Now it's too early so as to throw any reflection, that will come later once I get "home" (so the pictures of the trip will come); but I just wanted to say I'm safe and sound, my friend Jesus has already picked me up and I'll stay at his place today and tomorrow; on friday, I'll get on a bus and, after 15 hours through the Californian coast and inwards, I hope I gett off in Phoenix, AZ. There my new housemate will pick me up and take me to what it'll be my new "home" for 10 months in Tempe, AZ.<br />
The new life is coming right up!!! Until then, let's enjoy San Francisco :)</div>
