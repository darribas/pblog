<p align="justify">Yesterday I was all the day long travelling by bus and plane, I have barely slept a few hours, I couldn't take a shower and I guess I'm still sort of drunk because I'm not feeling hung over yet. Definitely, it's not the best way to welcome a 12-hours flight to take me back home.</p>
<p align="justify">And, with no doubt at all, I couldn't have imagined myself a better last night in Korea. Sweet because it happened, bitter because it's over. And I cannot help remembering once again that sentence of the song:</p>
<p align="center"><em>...I mean I love to travel, </em><em>I hate to fly</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>I want to go, but hate goodbyes...</em></p>
<p>Next time, at home already.</p>
