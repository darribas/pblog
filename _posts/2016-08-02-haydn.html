<blockquote>No composer had ever been left to develop so peacefully and with so many resources at his command than Haydn, who acknowledged, “My Prince was always satisfied with my works; I not only had the encouragement of constant approval, but as conductor of an orchestra, I could make experiments, observe what produced an effect and what weakened it, and was thus in a position to improve, alter, make additions or omissions, and be as bold as I pleased. I was cut off from the world, there was no one to confuse or torment me, and I was forced to become original.”</p></blockquote>
