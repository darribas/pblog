<p style="text-align:justify;">Charlie steps into my office and suggests going for a beer. It's thursday, 10pm and I've been working a good deal of the day, I accept. On our way there, while we ride our bikes, we talk about his trip down to Tucson's mountains for rock climbing. At some point, he asks: "<em>so, do you wanna come out?</em>" Before he's ended the question I've already said yes. So last friday we got on his car with Andrew (a programmer also related to the GeoDa Center) and headed south. All along yesterday, we hiked trying to find the place where they wanted to climb, but the <em>approach hike</em> turned into a <em>day-long</em> hike. But who cares? At the end of the day, after such a wonderful sunset in the sabannah-like landscape, we set a campfire and talked for a while under the fully starred sky. Really nice getaway from the Phoenix area, in which I also had the chance to dive into the american mind and learn so much about how americans view life and world. Here you have some pix to testify I was there; althoug I don't show up in any of them, trust me I was behind...</p>
