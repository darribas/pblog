<p style="text-align:justify;">I'm spending such a nice week in the big Apple attending the <a href="http://spatialeconometr.altervista.org/">SEA</a> Annual Meeting these days. I got to New York after a few days withh my buddies road-tripping around California and Vegas and it was such a nice time as well. On saturday, I landed in Newwark after not very much of sleep and headed to my hostel up in Harlem, stopping by first at a very nice afro-american restaurant fo dinner (or lunch, actually, even thoug it was 9pm). At the hostel, I got to know a bunch of people who was going out so I overcome my tiredness and headed downtonw for a beer, it was funny. On saturday, I went to a very nice tiny and pretty cafe right by Columbia University to have a proper NY cheesecake and to try to work a little bit; after that, I walked around Central Park, which was displaying such nice fall colours, and made it to 5th. avenue. I took there the bus and headed to Tribecca where I was supposed to meet my "new friends" from the hostel for dinner. We had a funny dinner down in China Town and finished off the night on a Jazz club right at Duke Ellington St. It couldn't have been better: being on a jazz club, listening to live music, right in the middel of New York was such a remarkable experience for a guy like me who's getting closer to be in love with The bohemian music style...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On monday, I left the 10-people-and-narrow-bed hostel where I was staying and switched gears to the high-stand hotel down in Brooklyn where the conference is taking place. It was really nice to meet some people from the time I spent in Rome, catch up and make new contacts. Today I presented <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/node/285">my paper</a> and it actually felt pretty good. Of course there were things to improve, but my overall feeling was quite happy, just hope the rest in the room though the same :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I'll stay here till saturday, then I'll back to Phoenix for a couple of weeks to slow-down and catch up with my daily work. It'll presumably also be my last time at my current house in Tempe, since I'll be moving to a closer to the university location in January. It was a pretty hard decission since my time with my housemate has been such a great one and he's treated me really well; on the other hand, I think the new place will bring a different and new experience, and I tend to think that's always enriching. And after that... back home, sweet home for Christmas!</p>
