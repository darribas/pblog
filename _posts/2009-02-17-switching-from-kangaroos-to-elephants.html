<p style="text-align:justify;">Right when I'm getting done with my adventure on <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/node/285">kangaroos</a>, here it comes the next one! This time is not about writing a paper about the farthest away from home country but about actually going somewhere. The <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu">GeoDa Center</a> I'm visiting this year is starting now to work and collaborate with the <a href="http://www.ncf-india.org/">Nature Conservation Foundation</a> in India; the main purpose is to try to bring spatial analysis tools into wildlife conservation to help understand and manage the relationship between humans and animals. It is meant to be a long term relationship with a lot of results expected, but one of the first steps made to start walking down this road is the celebration of a two-day long workshop on spatial analysis and techniques for grad students and scholars to take place at the <a href="http://www.ncbs.res.in/">NCBS</a> in Bangalore in July. I was offered to be part of the <em>team</em> which will go into the field and teach the course and, before the offer was ended, I had already said yes. So, if all goes as expected, <strong>next July 14th. I'll get on a plane to Mumbay</strong> and spend 10 days in one of the countries which for a long time was on my <em>to-go</em> list but never actually found a good excuse for. Teaching at one of the cutting-edge centers for biological sciences in India seems like a good one, doesn't it?</p>
