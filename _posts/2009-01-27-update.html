<p style="text-align:justify;">I know I've been pretty absent for the last two months, but I guess a pretty crazy month back home for Christmas and a really hectic back to the desert with the <em>post-Chistmas depression</em> and a paper to be re-done make up for a good excuse, if that can be accepted :)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Christmas back home was good, pretty stressing and with some sad parts, but it was nice overall. Meeting friends, eating good and travelling around the beautiful part of this world where I belong. What else can I ask for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, I just wanted to drop a few lines to update my life for those interested:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>I've moved from the house where I lived during fall to a much closer one and it's turning out to have been a very good decission, now I live in a smaller place but way closer to "life" (it's closer to the uni and to downtown), which is good when you don't have a car.</li>
<li>I've arranged a trip to California for next weekend: I'll fly out on friday to LA, have dinner with Ago and spend the night there and, on saturday morning, I'll get on a plane to SF to have remember weekend with some friend I made in Korea. I'l post the pics and more once back home.</li>
<li>I've missed home like hell and I've (am) worked my ass right off.</li>
<li>And I'm still learning and happy...</li>
</ul>
