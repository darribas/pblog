<p style="text-align:justify;">This morning, while I was doing some "<em>life sustainer</em>" tasks (aka cleaning, cooking, laundry...) I put on my headphones one of the last episodes ofÂ  <a href="http://www.thechangingworld.org/index.php">The Changing World</a>, a series of BBC documentaries about global issues. <a href="http://www.thechangingworld.org/archives/2011/wk5.php">This one</a> was an overview about the phenomenon of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_%28people%29">marches</a> and how peaceful colective actions have influenced the XX Century, from the marches of Gandhi to the speeches of Luther King or the Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March">Long March</a>. Most recomended. As an advance, I'll leave here a powerful excerpt from Ghandi, but a full listen is most recommended, very inspiring and encouraging stuff for all <em>professional dreamers</em> out there to see how it's the sum of many apparently insignificant facts that make History.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I regard myself as a soldier, though a soldier of peace; I know the value of discipline and truth; I have never made a statement that the massif of India, if it became neccesary would ressort to violence. I regard myself incapable of making statements of this sort.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">M. K. Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>
