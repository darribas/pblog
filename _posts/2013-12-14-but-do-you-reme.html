<blockquote>But do you remember how we talked about taking over the world and all that? That does not feel important anymore. The only thing that matters is the goosebumps I get when I'm recording a new song; the feeling of entering unexplored locations every time I close the door behind me in the mic booth. Maybe that's just because I've already conquered the world. At least my own world. Because every time I make a song I define myself.</p></blockquote>
