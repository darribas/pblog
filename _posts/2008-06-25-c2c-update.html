<p style="text-align:justify;">So I got a car. Well, we got a <em>rented</em> car. I had been somehow nervous seeing the day coming closer and closer and not doing anything, but getting more nervous. So on tuesday we decided to finally get rid of this pain. After a really nice italian lunch under some trees as umbrella and an improvised <em>siesta</em> (the heat was really pushing us to the couch) we sat in front of the computer and started scooping rental car websites. After a while, a few shocks due to the numbers we were seeing and some deeper search, we came out with the final choice: a Chevrolet from Alamo through a british web-operator :) I guess it couldn't have been anything better than a <em>Chevie</em> for my Coast2Coast.</p>
