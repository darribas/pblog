<p align="justify">Yesterday I was walkking around the old centre of Taipei almost all the day long. I the night, I met my friend from Sweden and some friends of her for a drink, trying to get deeper into taiwanese culture, hehe. Today I've just waken up and had breakfast and now waiting for my friend coming from Taijung this morning. We'll stay in Taipei at least one more day and, if the weather allows us, we'll go travelling the island around on sunday or monday.</p>
<p>The only con is this:</p>

<p align="justify">Yet, locals are not that worried, neither am I. It looks like it'll last for 2 or 3 days and the precaution we are required to take is staying away from he mountains and the beach and shuting down AC and windows. I guess I can handle it. Mom, Dad, I'll be safe ;)</p>
