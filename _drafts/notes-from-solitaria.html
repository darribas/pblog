<p>For most of the last five years, I've been (un)fortunate enough to inhabit Solitaria. Like many other, it is one of those places you don't choose to live but just find yourself in one day; unlike many other, however, it does not have a flag, a constitution or even borders. Solitaria is a foreign country, a foreign language; home on vacation and anywhere else when not; it's space and time compressed through a flight. In Solitaria, you may sleep at a friend's couch in Barcelona or in a five stars hotel in DC, wake up by the train window in Amsterdam or fall asleep at the back seat of a bus heading to Bangkok.  Here your office is usually limited to a laptop because otherwise it wouldn't fit in a plane, and the constant need to stay close to an internet connection becomes almost pathologic for the outsider's eyes, but that's only because they  probably don't know it's one of the very few things that follow you wherever you are and the only one that allows you to stay close to everything XXX.</p>
<p>As a home in the exile, it's gained some components that make it look as if it was a normal one: it sounds like jazz from the 'Uptown' or XXX; usually comes with a good book or something to read; and it definitely smells like coffee.</p>
<p>As much as it may sound, Solitaria is not always fun. It is, by definition, a one-man nation; true, it's got a lot of allies, but this is mainly about you by yourself in the middle of the cross-road, constantly changing and trying to stay on top of things.</p>
