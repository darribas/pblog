<blockquote>if this pattern of yours was easy to find you would have found it by now. Suppose you're right and this man is leaving some sort of a trail, then this is going to come down to geography and data. So, you're good with patterns and I'm alright with maps, that's a start. But there's going to be a ton of data, and how are you going to know what's relevant and what isn't? You need someone who can remember it all. And that means Lucy. And you know what else? You have to get that data in the first place. Records, documents, files, probably restricted files at that. Jean!?</p></blockquote>
